  abstract = {The existing bathymetry map of the Arctic is a compilation of ship soundings and digitized contours. Due to the presence of all-year sea ice, costly operations and political restrictions, dense and full coverage of the Arctic is not possible, leaving huge gaps between the existing surveys. In this paper, we make use of the existing Arctic bathymetry IBCAOv3 and invert Arctic bathymetry from the recent altimetric gravity model DTU17, whose accuracy is improved significantly with revised data processing strategy. The long and short wavelength components are preserved from IBCAOv3. The band-pass-filtering function proposed by Smith and Sandwell (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/94JB00988) is adapted for the Arctic by reducing the cutoff wavelength. The predicted bathymetry is within 100 m on 85.8\% of the grid nodes, when compared to the IBCAOv3. The consistency of the prediction is validated with two independent profiles from Healy cruises conducted in 2016 over the Chukchi Cap. A questionable valley in the IBCAOv3 is detected with gravity and at this spot, bathymetry predicted from gravity is consistent with independent multibeam soundings. The gravity-inverted bathymetry could be combined with ship soundings for the next generation of Arctic bathymetry map.},

Thwaites Glacier flows across the tectonic fabric of the West Antarctic rift system with its bedrock highs and sedimentary basins. Swath radar and seismic surveys of the glacier bed have revealed soft-sediment flutes 100 m or more high extending 15 km or more across basins downglacier from bedrock highs. Flutes end at prominent hard-bedded moats on stoss sides of the next topographic highs. We use simple models to show that ice flow against topography increases pressure between ice and till upglacier along the bed over a distance that scales with the topography. In this basal zone of high pressure, ice-contact water would be excluded, thus increasing basal drag by increasing ice-till coupling and till flux, removing till to allow bedrock erosion that creates moats. Till carried across highlands would then be deposited in lee-side positions forming bedforms that prograde downglacier over time, and that remain soft on top through feedbacks that match till-deformational fluxes from well upglacier of the topography. The bedforms of the part of Thwaites surveyed here are prominent because ice flow has persisted over a long time on this geological setting, not because ice flow is anomalous. Bedform development likely has caused evolution of ice flow over time as till and lubricating water were redistributed, moats were eroded and bedforms grew.},

Interpreting the evolution of glacier fronts requires information about their depth below sea level and ocean thermal forcing, which are incompletely known in the region. Here, we combine airborne gravity and multibeam echo sounding data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) mission with ocean probe and fishing boat depth data to reconstruct the bathymetry extending from the glacier margins to the edges of the continental shelf. We perform a three-dimensional inversion of the gravity data over water and merge the solution with a mass conservation reconstruction of bed topography over land. In contrast with other parts of Greenland, we find few deep troughs connecting the glaciers to the sources of warm Atlantic Water, amidst a relatively uniform, shallow (350 m) continental shelf. The deep channels include the Kangerlugssuaq, Sermilik, Gyldenl\o ve, and Tingmiarmiut Troughs.},

  abstract = {Marine-terminating glaciers dominate the evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to sea-level rise. Widespread glacier acceleration has been linked to the warming of ocean waters around the periphery of Greenland but a lack of information on the bathymetry of the continental shelf and glacial fjords has limited our ability to understand how subsurface, warm, salty ocean waters of Atlantic origin (AW) reach the glaciers and melt them from below. Here, we employ high-resolution, airborne gravity data (AIRGrav) in combination with multibeam echo sounding (MBES) data, to infer the bathymetry of the coastal areas of Northwest Greenland for NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission. High-resolution, AIRGrav data acquired on a 2 km spacing, 150 m ground clearance, with 1.5 mGal crossover error, is inverted in three dimensions to map the bathymetry. To constrain the inversion away from MBES data, we compare two methods: one based on the Direct Current (DC) shift of the gravity field (absolute minus observed gravity) and another based on the density of the bedrock. We evaluate and compare the two methods in areas with complete MBES coverage. We find the lowest standard error in bed elevation ({$\pm$}60 m) using the DC shift method. When applied to the entire coast of Northwest Greenland, the three-dimensional inversion reveals a complex network of connected sea bed channels, not known previously, that provide natural and varied pathways for AW to reach the glaciers across the continental shelf. The study demonstrates that the gravity approach offers an efficient and practical alternative to extensive ship mapping in ice-filled waters to obtain information critical to understanding and modeling ice-ocean interaction along ice sheet margins.},

Here we employ high-resolution, helicopter-borne gravity data from 2012 to reconstruct its bed elevation within 50 km of the ocean margin using a three-dimensional inversion constrained by fjord bathymetry data offshore and a mass conservation algorithm inland.

We use geomorphic data to reconstruct Last Glacial Maximum and post-Last Glacial Maximum ice sheet drainage and demonstrate retreat behaviours for the East Antarctic and West Antarctic sectors of the ice sheet. Using this framework, we then use seismic data and chronostratigraphic information from drill cores to reconstruct the long-term evolution of the ice sheet. Early ice sheet evolution during the Late Oligocene was characterized by isolated ice caps on bathymetric highs, followed by an interval of sediment infilling of rift basins and the development of more subdued relief in the eastern Ross Sea than in the western Ross Sea. Both ice sheets have experienced multiple episodes of expansion across the continental shelf since the Middle Miocene, with the frequency increasing during the Plio-Pleistocene. We conclude that seafloor bathymetry has been the principal control on ice sheet palaeodrainage and retreat behaviour since at least the middle Miocene, demonstrated by broad West Antarctic ice streams loosely guided by south to north crossshelf troughs, whereas East Antarctic ice streams were funnelled through troughs that merge and converge around banks.},

Using the records from 122 broadband seismic stations, over 10,000 Rayleigh wave fundamental-mode dispersion curves have been retrieved from earthquake waveforms and from ambient noise. Using the processed data set, a 3-D S-velocity model for the Antarctic lithosphere was constructed using a single-step surface wave tomographic method, and a Moho depth map was estimated from the model. Using the derived crustal thicknesses, the average ratio of lithospheric mantle and crustal densities of Antarctica was calculated. The calculated density ratio indicates that the average crustal density for Antarctica is much higher than the average values for continental crust or the average density of lithospheric mantle is so low as to be equal to low-density bound of Archean lithosphere. The latter implies that the lithospheric mantle in much of Antarctica should be old and of Archean age. The East Antarctic Mountain Ranges (EAMOR) represent a thick crustal belt, with the thickest crust (\textasciitilde 60 km) located close to Dome A. Very high velocities can be found at depths greater than 200 km beneath parts of East Antarctica, demonstrating that the continental lithosphere extends deeper than 200 km. The very thick crust beneath the EAMOR may represent the collision suture of East Gondwana with Indo-Antarctica and West Gondwana during the Pan-African orogeny.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP) remains uncertain and has important implications for our understanding of ice sheet response to modern global warming. The extent to which marine-based sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) retreated during the MPWP is particularly contentious, with geological observations and geochemical analyses being cited to argue for either a relatively minor or a significant ice sheet retreat in response to mid-Pliocene warming. The stability of marine-based ice sheets is intimately linked to bedrock elevation at their grounding lines, and previous ice sheet modeling assumed that Antarctic bedrock elevation during the MPWP was the same as today with the exception of a correction for the crustal response to ice loading. However, various processes may have perturbed bedrock elevation over the past 3 m.y., most notably vertical deflections of the crust driven by mantle convective flow, or dynamic topography. Here we present simulations of mantle convective flow that are consistent with a wide range of present-day observables and use them to predict changes in dynamic topography and reconstruct bedrock elevations during the MPWP. We incorporate these elevations into a simulation of the Antarctic ice sheet during the MPWP and find that the correction for dynamic topography change has a significant effect on the stability of the EAIS within the marine-based Wilkes Basin, with the ice margin in that sector retreating considerably further inland (200\textendash 560 km) relative to simulations that do not include this correction for bedrock elevation.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization provides sample-efficient global optimization for a broad range of applications, including automatic machine learning, engineering, physics, and experimental design. We introduce BoTorch, a modern programming framework for Bayesian optimization that combines Monte-Carlo (MC) acquisition functions, a novel sample average approximation optimization approach, auto-differentiation, and variance reduction techniques. BoTorch's modular design facilitates flexible specification and optimization of probabilistic models written in PyTorch, simplifying implementation of new acquisition functions. Our approach is backed by novel theoretical convergence results and made practical by a distinctive algorithmic foundation that leverages fast predictive distributions, hardware acceleration, and deterministic optimization. We also propose a novel "one-shot" formulation of the Knowledge Gradient, enabled by a combination of our theoretical and software contributions. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of BoTorch relative to other popular libraries.},

  abstract = {The launch of ERS-l provides coverage, by satellite altimetry, of a large part of the Ross Ice Shelf ineluding areas of input from Byrd Glacier and Ice Streams D and E. Five 35 d repeats of fast-delivery data, comprising approximately 100000 height estimates, have been used to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Ross Icc Shelf north of 81.5\textdegree{} S. Careful filtering of the altimeter data, which removed about 30\% of the measurements, ensured that only valid values were used. The data were grldded to produce a DEM with a cell size of 10km. Repeatability of the data was assessed from an analysis of crossing points of ascending and descending tracks. The rms cross-over difference for the ice shelf was 0.94 m. Using the five repeat tracks gave a random error of 0.30 m for an averaged height measurement. Regionally correlated errors in the orbit and geoid add a systematic long wavelength bias of approximately 2m to the final elevation estimate. Two of the latest geoid models, OSU91-A and JGMI, were compared with the available in situ data and hYdrostatic models based on ice and water densities.The altimetry was compared with ice-thickness data from Ross Icc Shelf Geophysical and Glaciological Survey (RIGGS) stations and Scott Polar Research Institute radio-echo-sounding surveys undertaken in the 1970s. Differences between the DEM and heights calculated from ice thicknesses and a standard density -depth equation lie, in general, within the combined measurement errors. There are, however, several areas where this is not the case. Prominent north-south stripes of different ice thickness shown on a RIGGS map apparently do not exist. Low elevations are associated with high-density ice draining from East Antarctic outlet glaciers. The grounding line of Icc Streams D and E and an ice plain behind it are clearly demarcated by the break in surface slope. Grounded ice north of Steershead is also observed},

  abstract = {The ice sheets covering Antarctica and Greenland present the greatest uncertainty in, and largest potential contribution to, future sea level rise. The uncertainty arises from a paucity of suitable observations covering the full range of ice sheet behaviors, incomplete understanding of the influences of diverse processes, and limitations in defining key boundary conditions for the numerical models. To investigate the impact of these uncertainties on ice sheet projections we undertook a structured expert judgement study. Here, we interrogate the findings of that study to identify the dominant drivers of uncertainty in projections and their relative importance as a function of ice sheet and time. We find that for the 21st century, Greenland surface melting, in particular the role of surface albedo effects, and West Antarctic ice dynamics, specifically the role of ice shelf buttressing, dominate the uncertainty. The importance of these effects holds under both a high-end 5\textdegree C global warming scenario and another that limits global warming to 2\textdegree C. During the 22nd century the dominant drivers of uncertainty shift. Under the 5\textdegree C scenario, East Antarctic ice dynamics dominate the uncertainty in projections, driven by the possible role of ice flow instabilities. These dynamic effects only become dominant, however, for a temperature scenario above the Paris Agreement 2\textdegree C target and beyond 2100. Our findings identify key processes and factors that need to be addressed in future modeling and observational studies in order to reduce uncertainties in ice sheet projections.},

This demonstration is accomplished by inverting the gravity data with the constraint that the estimated basement relief presents local abrupt faults and is smooth elsewhere. We inverted the gravity data from the onshore Almada Basin in northeastern Brazil, and we mapped several normal faults whose locations and plane geometries were already known from seismic imaging. The inversion method delineated well both the discontinuities with small or large slips and a sequence of step faults. Using synthetic data, we performed a systematic search of normal fault slips versus fault displacement depths to map the fault-detectable region in this space. This mapping helps to assess the ability of gravity inversion to detect normal faults. Mapping shows that normal faults with small ͑Ͻ0.5 km͒, medium ͑about 1 km͒, and large ͑about 2 km͒ vertical slips can be detected if the maximum midpoint depths of the fault planes are smaller than 1.8, 3.8, and 6.8 km, respectively.},

We used new GPS measurements, which show a rapid (41 millimeters per year) uplift of the ASE, to estimate the viscosity of the mantle underneath. We found a much lower viscosity (4 \texttimes{} 10               18               pascal-second) than global average, and this shortens the GIA response time scale to decades up to a century.

The difficulty of measuring GHF below ice sheets has directly hindered progress in the understanding of ice sheet dynamics. We present a new GHF measurement from below the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, made in subglacial sediment near the grounding zone of the Whillans Ice Stream. The measured GHF is 88 {$\pm$} 7 mW m\`A2, a relatively high value compared to other continental settings and to other GHF measurements along the eastern Ross Sea of 55 mW m\`A2 and 69 {$\pm$} 21 mW m\`A2 but within the range of regional values indicated by geophysical estimates. The new GHF measurement was made \textasciitilde 100 km from the only other direct GHF measurement below the ice sheet, which was considerably higher at 285 {$\pm$} 80 mW m\`A2, suggesting spatial variability that could be explained by shallow magmatic intrusions or the advection of heat by crustal fluids. Analytical calculations suggest that spatial variability in GHF exceeds spatial variability in the conductive heat flux through ice along the Siple Coast. Accurate GHF measurements and high-resolution GHF models may be necessary to reliably predict ice sheet evolution, including responses to ongoing and future climate change.},

Consequently, when plans were being made for drilling an access hole to the ocean beneath the interior of the shelf, it was decided to conduct an airlifted survey covering the entire ice shelf: the Ross Ice Shelf Geophysical and Glaciological Survey (RIGGS). Measurements of many kinds were carried out at the 200 RIGGS stations over the 5-year period 1973-1978. Quantities de\- termined included accumulation rate, strain rate, ice thickness, subglacial water depth, and gravity at 75-95\% of the sites; tempera\- tures and movement rate at 40-50\% of the sites; seismic and radio wave velocities and electrical resistivities at 10-20 sites; and radar polarization at six sites. More exten\- sive programs, including core drilling to 50-100 m, tidal-gravity recording, and long seismic refraction profiles to investigate submarine geologic structure, were carried out at 10 primary and supplementary base camps. In addition, 13,500 km of airborne radar sounding were completed. Detailed sea\- sonal tabulations of the types and locations of measurements are presented in this paper, along with a brief season-by-season narrative.},

Of particular interest in Antarctica are the crustal thickness variations under the Transantarctic Mountains and Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, whose formation mechanisms are still debated. We have used a mean, global gravity field from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to estimate the depth to the Moho in East and West Antarctica through gravity inversion. We then combined the depth to Moho and known topography to estimate the total crustal thickness. Thick crust is resolved along the full length of the Transantarctic Mountains with a maximum crustal thickness of 46 km predicted near the pole and thinner (\textasciitilde{} 40 km) crust in both northern Victoria Land and under the Pensacola Mountains. Within East Antarctica, the model predicts crust over 40 km thick below the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, which may be the result of a Neoproterozoic suture zone underlying the ice sheet. In addition to addressing long-standing questions about the nature of East Antarctica's major mountain ranges, an improved estimate of crustal thickness variability may improve long-wavelength geodynamic and glaciological models of the continent.},

We also used this technique to recover subice topography where warm or crevassed ice prevents the radar system from imaging the bed. Here we discuss our methodology, basic assumptions and error analysis. We present the new bathymetry data and discuss observations in six major regions of Greenland covered by IceBridge. The gravity models provide a total of 1950 line kilometers of bathymetry, 875 line kilometers of subice topography, and 12 new grounding line depths.},

  abstract = {In the last years the scientific literature has been enriched with new models of the Moho depth in the Antarctica Continent derived by the seismic reflection technique and refraction profiles, receiver functions and seismic surface waves, but also by gravimetric observations over the continent. In particular, the gravity satellite missions of the last two decades have provided data in this remote region of the Earth and have allowed the investigation of the crust properties. Meanwhile, other important contributions in this direction has been given by the fourth International Polar Year (IPY, 2007\textendash 2008) which started seismographic and geodetic networks of unprecedented duration and scale, including airborne gravimetry over largely unexplored Antarctic frontiers. In this study, a new model for the Antarctica Moho depths is proposed. This new estimation is based on no satellite gravity measures, thanks to the availability of the gravity database ANTGG2015, that collects gravity data from ground-base, airborne and shipborne campaigns. In this new estimate of the Moho depths the contribution of the gravity measures has been maximized reducing any correction of the gravity measures and avoiding constraints of the solution to seismological observations and to geological evidence. With this approach a pure gravimetric solution has been determined. The model obtained is pretty in agreement with other Moho models and thanks to the use of independent data it can be exploited also for cross-validating different Moho depths solutions.},

Here we use a three-dimensional ice sheet model to simulate ice flow in this region over 250 years. The flow responds to changing basal properties, as a subglacial till layer interacts with water transported in an active subglacial hydrological system. We show that a persistent weak bed beneath the tributaries of the dormant Kamb Ice Stream is a source of internal ice flow instability, which reorganizes all ice streams in this region, leading to a reduced (positive) mass balance within decades and a net loss of ice within two centuries. This hitherto unaccounted for flow variability could raise sea level by 5 mm this century. Better constraints on future sea level change from this region will require improved estimates of geothermal heat flux and subglacial water transport.},

Using targeted examples, we demonstrate previously obscured behavior showing the dependence of linear smoothers on the spatial arrangement of the measurements, yielding markedly different estimation results than the Kalman filter. For bathymetry data, we have modified the variance estimates from both the Kalman filter and linear smoothers to obtain comparable estimators for dense data. These comparable estimators produce uncertainty estimates that have statistically insignificant differences via hypothesis testing. Achieving comparable estimation is accomplished by applying the ``propagated uncertainty'' concept and a numerical realization of Tobler's principle to the measurement data prior to the computation of the estimate. We show new mathematical derivations for these modifications. In addition, we show test results with (a) synthetic data and (b) gridded bathymetry in the area of the Scripps and La Jolla Canyons. Our tenfold cross-validation for case (b) shows that the modified equations create comparable uncertainty for both gridding algorithms with null hypothesis acceptance rates of greater than 99.95\% of the data points. In contrast, bilinear interpolation has 10 times the amount of rejection. We then discuss how the uncertainty estimators are, in principle, applicable to interpolate geophysical data other than bathymetry.},

  abstract = {Seismic reflection soundings of ice thickness and seabed depth were acquired on the Larsen C Ice Shelf in order to test a sub-ice shelf bathymetry model derived from the inversion of IceBridge gravity data. A series of lines was collected, from the Churchill Peninsula in the north to the Joerg Peninsula in the south, and also towards the ice front. Sites were selected using the bathymetry model derived from the inversion of free-air gravity data to indicate key regions where sub-ice shelf oceanic circulation may be affected by ice draft and seabed depth. The seismic velocity profile in the upper 100 m of firn and ice was derived from shallow refraction surveys at a number of locations. Measured temperatures within the ice column and at the ice base were used to define the velocity profile through the remainder of the ice column. Seismic velocities in the water column were derived from previous in situ measurements. Uncertainties in ice and water cavity thickness are in general {$<$}10 m. Compared with the seismic measurements, the rootmean-square error in the gravimetrically derived bathymetry at the seismic sites is 162 m. The seismic profiles prove the non-existence of several bathymetric features that are indicated in the gravity inversion model, significantly modifying the expected oceanic circulation beneath the ice shelf. Similar features have previously been shown to be highly significant in affecting basal melt rates predicted by ocean models. The discrepancies between the gravity inversion results and the seismic bathymetry are attributed to the assumption of uniform geology inherent in the gravity inversion process and also the sparsity of IceBridge flight lines. Results indicate that care must be taken when using bathymetry models derived by the inversion of free-air gravity anomalies. The bathymetry results presented here will be used to improve existing sub-ice shelf ocean circulation models.},

Ice shelf thinning due to basal melting results from the circulation of relatively warm water in the underlying ocean cavity. However, the effect of sub-shelf circulation on future ice shelf stability cannot be predicted accurately with computer simulations if the geometry of the ice shelf cavity is unknown. To address this deficit for Larsen C Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, we integrate new water column thickness measurements from recent seismic campaigns with existing observations. We present these new data here along with an updated bathymetry grid of the ocean cavity. Key findings include a relatively deep seabed to the southeast of the Kenyon Peninsula, along the grounding line and around the key ice shelf pinning-point of Bawden Ice Rise. In addition, we can confirm that the cavity's southern trough stretches from Mobiloil Inlet to the open ocean. These areas of deep seabed will influence ocean circulation and tidal mixing and will therefore affect the basal-melt distribution. These results will help constrain models of ice shelf cavity circulation with the aim of improving our understanding of sub-shelf processes and their potential influence on ice shelf stability.},

We review the methods to extract GHF, compile borehole and probe-derived estimates from measured temperature profiles, and recommend the following future directions: 1) Obtain more borehole-derived estimates from the subglacial bedrock and englacial temperature profiles. 2) Estimate GHF beneath the interior of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (the region most sensitive to GHF variation) via long-wavelength microwave emissivity. 3) Estimate GHF from inverse glaciological modelling, constrained by evidence for basal melting. 4) Revise geophysically-derived GHF estimates using a combination of Curie depth, seismic, and thermal isostasy models. 5) Integrate in these geophysical approaches a more accurate model of the structure and distribution of heat production elements within the crust, and considering heterogeneities in the underlying mantle.

Establishing the uncertainty in a dense gridded product from sparse or random uncertainty-attributed input data is not, however, routine. This manuscript develops an equation that propagates the uncertainty of individual observations, arbitrarily distributed in R2, to a common estimation location at which they can be used to determine the composite uncertainty of the output field. The equation includes the effect of the distance between the observation and estimation locations, the field and horizontal uncertainty of the observation, and user-parameters to control the expected variability in the field as a function of distance. Two computational versions of the equation, a lower cost conservative approach and a higher cost mean-distance approach, are developed and evaluated for computational cost and resulting accuracy in numerical experiments over simulated bathymetric data. The mean-distance approach is more accurate, but more costly; suitable numerical approximations are proposed to control computational costs. A benefit of the work described is flexibility and enhancement for applications of the model, such as the Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetry Estimator algorithm, which is used as a demonstration of the difference between the two versions of the equation.},

The synthesized history shows significant short-term variability in ice-stream shear margin and grounding line position due to internal variability of the coupled system. The chronology highlights the interplay between adjacent ice streams, which implies that the behavior of any individual ice stream should not be examined in isolation. Furthermore, individual events cannot be fully interpreted without an understanding of the broad-scale, long-term variability in the ice sheet. In the context of this millennium-scale history, we interpret the relatively recent stagnation of Kamb Ice Stream (KIS) as just one stage in the thermodynamic cycle of an ice stream in this region. The changes in mass balance that result from the KIS stagnation may thus be viewed as century-scale `noise' relative to the longer-term trend. Understanding and characterizing this noise is a necessary step before accurate model-based predictions of ice-sheet mass balance for the next century can be made.},

We derive the effective elastic thickness Te as a proxy for these parameters by using ice thickness, bedrock topography and a combination of new satellite and high resolution terrestrial gravity data. Cross-spectral analysis based on the fan wavelet technique was employed to calculate Te variations by means of admittance and coherence techniques. Our results confirm a clear tectonic division of Antarctica with predominantly high values in East Antarctica (EANT) (Te \textasciitilde{} 60\textendash 80 km) and low values in West Antarctica (WANT) (Te \textasciitilde{} 5\textendash 20 km). For the Transantarctic Mountains separating these provinces, we found Te to be around 10 km along the whole chain which is comparable to WANT. Apart from this general division, we found fragmentation of the lithosphere within these provinces. Especially EANT doesn't represent a single lithospheric block but shows strong variations of Te. The highest values are found around the Aurora Subglacial Basin (Te \textasciitilde{} 90 km) and in Dronning Maud Land (Te \textasciitilde{} 80 km). The minimum value of Te within EANT (\textasciitilde 15 km) is found in the Lambert Graben. Such a low value can be associated with active rifting in the Permian-Triassic, strong localized erosion or possibly the effect of a Cenozoic mantle plume. According to the coherence calculations, the weak zone extends to the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), showing a distinct decrease of Te to 25\textendash 30 km. Thus, this weak channel divides the previously mentioned strong blocks. However, the admittance analysis gives relatively high values (Te \textasciitilde{} 70 km) for the GSM. Based on the analysis of the wavelength-dependent admittance and coherence results and misfits for several principal locations, we give some preference to the coherence based values.},

This compilation is a component of the ongoing IAGA/SCAR Antarctic Digital Magnetic Anomaly Project (ADMAP). The aeromagnetic surveys total 115 000 line km, and are distributed across the Victoria Land sector of the TAM, the Ross Sea, and Marie Byrd Land. The magnetic campaigns were performed within the framework of the national and international Italian \textendash{} German \textendash{} US Antarctic research programs and conducted with differing specifications during nine field seasons from 1971 until 1997. Generally flight line spacing was less than 5 km while survey altitude varied from about 610 to 4000 m above sea level for barometric surveys and was equal to 305 m above topography for the single draped survey. Reprocessing included digitizing the old contour data, improved levelling by means of microlevelling in the frequency domain, and re-reduction to a common reference field based on the DGRF90 model. A multi-frequency grid procedure was then applied to obtain a coherent and merged total intensity magnetic anomaly map. The shaded relief map covers an area of approximately 380 000 km2. This new compilation provides a regional image of the location and spatial extent of the Cenozoic alkaline magmatism related to the TAM \textendash{} Ross Sea rift, Jurassic tholeiites, and crustal segments of the Early Palaeozoic magmatic arc. A linear, approximately 100-km wide and 600-km long Jurassic rift-like structure is newly identified. Magnetic fabric in the Ross Sea rift often matches seismically imaged Cenozoic fault arrays. Major buried onshore pre-rift fault zones, likely inherited from the Ross Orogen, are also delineated.

  abstract = {Satellite observations have revealed active hydrologic systems beneath Antarctic ice streams, but sources and sinks of water within these systems are uncertain. Here we use numerical simulations of ice streams to estimate the generation, flux, and budget of water beneath five ice streams on the Siple Coast. We estimate that 47\% of the total hydrologic input (0.98 km3 yr\`A1) to Whillans (WIS), Mercer (MIS), and Kamb (KIS) ice streams comes from the ice sheet interior and that only 8\% forms by local basal melting. The remaining 45\% comes from a groundwater reservoir, an overlooked source in which depletion significantly exceeds recharge. Of the total input to Bindschadler (BIS) and MacAyeal (MacIS) ice streams (0.56 km3 yr\`A1), 72\% comes from the interior, 19\% from groundwater, and 9\% from local melting. This contrasting hydrologic setting modulates the ice streams flow and has important implications for the search for life in subglacial lakes.},

Improved data sets of ice shelf draft and underlying bathymetry are important for assessing ocean\textendash ice interactions and modeling ice response to climate change. The long, narrow Abbot Ice Shelf south of Thurston Island produces a large volume of meltwater, but is close to being in overall mass balance. Here we invert NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne gravity data over the Abbot region to obtain sub-ice bathymetry, and combine OIB elevation and ice thickness measurements to estimate ice draft. A series of asymmetric fault-bounded basins formed during rifting of Zealandia from Antarctica underlie the Abbot Ice Shelf west of 94{$\smwhtcircle$} W and the Cosgrove Ice Shelf to the south. Sub-ice water column depths along OIB flight lines are sufficiently deep to allow warm deep and thermocline waters observed near the western Abbot ice front to circulate through much of the ice shelf cavity. An average ice shelf draft of {$\sim$} 200 m, 15 \% less than the Bedmap2 compilation, coincides with the summer transition between the ocean surface mixed layer and upper thermocline. Thick ice streams feeding the Abbot cross relatively stable grounding lines and are rapidly thinned by the warmest inflow. While the ice shelf is presently in equilibrium, the overall correspondence between draft distribution and thermocline depth indicates sensitivity to changes in characteristics of the ocean surface and deep waters.},

However, multiple cavity openings and complex geography mean that knowledge of bathymetry beneath the GIS is required to understand ice/ocean interactions. We invert NASA airborne gravity data to obtain bathymetry beneath the ice shelf. Our gravity/geology-constrained bathymetry is a significant advance on Bedmap2 bathymetry. The sub-ice shelf bathymetry consists of three cavities separated by topographic ridges extending from the ice shelf front to the grounding line. Passages allowing limited circulation of shallow ({$\lessequivlnt$}400 meters below sea level [mbsl]) water between cavities are present, but deeper water is confined to individual cavities. Within each cavity, bathymetric troughs ({$>$}900 mbsl) extend from the ice shelf front to subglacial valleys beneath the ice sheet. Our analysis of the gravity data also allows us to infer the presence of thick ({$>$}500 m) sediments near the grounding line through much of the GIS, as well as variations in the density and/or thickness of the crust underlying the ice shelf. Plain Language Summary Floating ice shelves surrounding Antarctica slow the flow of the Antarctic Ice Sheet toward the ocean. West Antarctic ice shelves, including the large Getz Ice Shelf, have thinned significantly over the past 20 years, due in part to increased flow of warming ocean water into the ocean cavities beneath them. This thinning results in acceleration of ice flowing into the ocean, so that more ice goes afloat, raising sea level. We mapped the shape of the ocean floor beneath the Getz Ice Shelf, which controls water circulation under the ice shelf. We found the ice shelf has three separate portions each with deep troughs that provide pathways for warm water to the edge of the ice sheet.},

  abstract = {A possible cause for accelerated thinning and break-up of floating marine ice shelves is warming of the water in the cavity below the ice shelf. Accurate bathymetry beneath large ice shelves is crucial for developing models of the ocean circulation in the sub-ice cavities. A grid of free-air gravity data over the floating Larsen C ice shelf collected during the IceBridge 2009 Antarctic campaign was utilized to develop the first bathymetry model of the underlying continental shelf. Independent control on the continental shelf geologic structures from marine surveys was used to constrain the inversion. Depths on the continental shelf beneath the ice shelf estimated from the inversion generally range from about 350 to 650 m, but vary from {$<$}300 to {$>$}1000 m. Localized overdeepenings, 20\textendash 30 km long and 900\textendash 1000 m deep, are located in inlets just seaward of the grounding line. Submarine valleys extending seaward from the overdeepenings coalesce into two broad troughs that extend to the seaward limit of the ice shelf and appear to extend to the edge of the continental shelf. The troughs are generally at a depth of 550\textendash 700 m although the southernmost mapped trough deepens to over 1000 m near the edge of the ice shelf just south of 688 S. The combination of the newly determined bathymetry with published ice-draft determinations based on laser altimetry and radar data defines the geometry of the water-filled cavity. These newly imaged troughs provide a conduit for water to traverse the continental shelf and interact with the overlying Larsen C ice shelf and the grounding lines of the outlet glaciers.},

  abstract = {Modeling the early development of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) hinges on the configuration and evolution of Paleogene terrestrial landscapes associated with the West Antarctic Rift System. A widely applied but previously untested paleotopographic reconstruction for the Eocene/Oligocene boundary suggests that much of central West Antarctica was as much as 1,000 m above sea level at that time, constituting a key nucleating site for an early WAIS. Here we show that Paleogene age marine and terrestrial microfossil assemblages and biomarkers in sediments recovered from beneath the WAIS provide direct evidence contrary to this widely utilized ``maximum'' paleotopographic reconstruction. These new constraints call for significantly modified tectonic and ice sheet model parameterization and also provide insights into modern differential uplift across the West Antarctic Rift System. Plain Language Summary The configuration and elevation of Antarctic land masses played a key role in early ice sheet development in a world with CO2 much higher than today's. Several studies have attempted to reconstruct the terrestrial landscape of the tectonically complex West Antarctica 34 million years ago, a time when a cooling climate led to Antarctic ice sheet growth. Here we use sedimentary records collected from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet interior to test published landscape reconstructions for this critical interval in Earth history. Marine microfossils (diatoms, dinoflagellates, calcareous nannofossils, and ebridians) are used to constrain the ages of sedimentary deposits. Additionally, we use terrestrial pollen, spores, and freshwater diatoms, as well as marine and terrestrial organic biomarkers, to document past sedimentary basins and reconstruct paleoenvironments during the transition from the warm Eocene (\textasciitilde 56 to 34 million years ago) to the cooler Oligocene (\textasciitilde 34 to 23 million years ago). Our results significantly advance knowledge of tectonic and landscape evolution across West Antarctica, thus calling for improved modeling of the early ice sheet.},

Localized basins ({$\sim$}1,400 m deep) are found beneath both ice shelves. The shallowest modeled bathymetry ({$\sim$}200 m) represents the offshore extension of Cape Freshfield. Near the grounding line, seafloor depths are found to be deeper than the observed depth of the modified Circumpolar Deep water in the region ({$<$}350 m), key factor for basal melt analyses.

The southern half of the Sound consists of two distinct basins \textasciitilde 1,100 m deep, separated by a -650 m-deep ridge.

We present a new bathymetric model of the seafloor beneath George VI Ice Shelf on the Antarctica Peninsula. The data for our model were collected from airborne surveys, including the ice surface elevation, ice thickness, and gravity field measurements. We first present a new geological model of the Sound and use our improved data coverage to relocate a previously interpreted geological fault. The new bathymetry model shows that in the southern segment of the Sound, an area with shallow bathymetry and deep ice might be acting as a barrier to the water flow. This information can change our understanding of the circulation between the northern and southern segments of the Sound and can be used in models of how this impacts the melt in the base of the ice shelf.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) lies on a solid Earth that displays large spatial variations in rheological properties, with a thin lithosphere and low-viscosity upper mantle (weak Earth structure) beneath West Antarctica and an opposing structure beneath East Antarctica. This contrast is known to have a significant impact on the ice-sheet grounding-line stability. Here, we embed within an icesheet model a modified glacial-isostatic Elastic Lithosphere-Relaxing Asthenosphere model that considers a dual pattern for the Earth structure beneath West and East Antarctica supplemented with an approximation of gravitationally consistent geoid changes, allowing to approximate near-field relative sea-level changes. We show that this elementary GIA model captures the essence of global SelfGravitating Viscoelastic solid-Earth Models (SGVEMs) and compares well with both SGVEM outputs and geodetic observations, allowing to capture the essential features and processes influencing Antarctic grounding-line stability in a computationally efficient way. In this framework, we perform a probabilistic assessment of the impact of uncertainties in solid-Earth rheological properties on the response of the AIS to future warming. Results show that on multicentennial-to-millennial timescales, spatial variability in solid-Earth deformation plays a significant role in promoting the stability of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). However, WAIS collapse cannot be prevented under high-emissions climate scenarios. On longer timescales and for unmitigated climate scenarios, continent-wide mass loss projections may be underestimated because spatially uniform Earth models, as typically considered in numerical ice sheet models, will overestimate the stabilizing effect of GIA across East Antarctica, which is characterized by thick lithosphere and high upper-mantle viscosity.},

  abstract = {The sudden, widespread glaciation of Antarctica and the associated shift toward colder temperatures near the Eocene\^Oligocene boundary (V34 Ma) represents one of the most fundamental reorganizations of the global climate system recognized in the geologic record. This glacial inception and the subsequent evolution of the early East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) are simulated using a new, coupled global climate\^dynamical ice sheet model accounting for the paleogeography, greenhouse gas concentrations, changing orbital parameters, and varying ocean heat transport. Suites of long (105 yr) climate\^ice sheet simulations are used to investigate the effects of declining atmospheric CO2, compared to those of the tectonic opening of Southern Ocean gateways and the timing of mountain uplift in the Antarctic interior. In contrast to the established paradigm for the glaciation of Antarctica, which centers on the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and the `thermal isolation' of the continent, our results show that declining Cenozoic pCO2 may have played the dominant role. First, small isolated ice caps formed on the highest Antarctic plateaus. Then, as a CO2 threshold between V3U and 2U pre-industrial level (PAL) was crossed, height\^ mass balance feedbacks were initiated during orbital periods with cold austral summers, triggering much larger, highly dynamic terrestrial ice sheets. As CO2 continued to decline, these isolated ice caps eventually merged into a permanent continental-scale EAIS. In our model, neither the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways nor mountain uplift significantly affected the timing of the major ice sheet transition, given a scenario of gradually declining CO2 from 4U to 2U PAL over 10 million years around the Eocene\^Oligocene boundary.},

  abstract = {Some commonly used interpolation algorithms are analyzed briefly in this paper. Among all of the methods, biharmonic spline interpolation, which is based on Green's function and proposed by Sandwell, has become the mainstream method for its high precision, simplicity and flexibility. However, the minimum curvature method has two flaws. First, it suffers from undesirable oscillations between data points, which is solved by interpolation with splines in tension. Second, the computation time is approximately proportional to the cube of the number of data constraints, making the method slow for situations with dense data coverage. Focusing on the second problem, this paper introduces the moving surface spline interpolation method based on Green's function, and the interpolation error equations are deduced. Because the proposed method only chooses the nearest data points by using the merge sort algorithm for interpolating, the computation time is greatly decreased. The optimal number of the nearest points can be determined by using the interpolation error estimation equation. No matter how many data points there are, this method can be implemented without difficulty. Examples show that the proposed method can obtain high interpolation precision and high computation speed at the same time.},

  abstract = {Observations beneath the floating section of Pine Island Glacier have revealed the presence of a subglacial ridge which rises up to 300 m above the surrounding bathymetry. This topographic feature probably served as a steady grounding line position until sometime before the 1970s, when an ongoing phase of rapid grounding line retreat was initiated. As a result, a large ocean cavity has formed behind the ridge, strongly controlling the ocean circulation beneath the ice shelf and modulating the ocean water properties that cause ice melting in the vicinity of the grounding line. In order to understand how melt rates have changed during the various phases of cavity formation, we use a high-resolution ocean model to simulate the cavity circulation for a series of synthetic geometries. We show that the height of the ridge and the gap between the ridge and ice shelf strongly control the inflow of warm bottom waters into the cavity, and hence the melt rates. Model results suggest a rapid geometrically controlled increase of meltwater production at the onset of ice thinning, but a weak sensitivity to geometry once the gap between the ridge and ice shelf has passed a threshold value of about 200 m. This provides evidence for a new, coupled, ice-ocean feedback acting to enhance the initial retreat of an ice stream from a bedrock high. The present gap is over 200 m, and our results suggest that observed variability in melt rates is now controlled by other factors, such as the depth of the thermocline.},

  abstract = {The present-day bathymetric profile in the Ross Sea, as in other regions around the Antarctic margin, is deepening landward and shows unusually high water-depths: up to 1000 m in the inner shelf. These two features are the product of multiple ice sheet advances and retreats on the continental shelf. In this paper, we present a reconstruction of paleo-bathymetric profiles of the Eastern Ross Sea throughout the Cenozoic. The evolution of the sea-floor morphology from shallow and seaward dipping to the present-day configuration gives new insights into the understanding of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet \v{Z}WAIS. history in this sector. Paleo-bathymetric profiles have been calculated by applying a reverse post-rift modelling, starting from a cross-section derived from multichannel seismic data. The post-rift reverse modelling includes: sediment decompaction, isostatic compensation after removing and recovering sediments of the post-rift thermal subsidence. The major uncertainty in our model is due to the paucity of stratigraphic constraints for the late Miocene and Pliocene sequences that prevents precise values of paleowater-depth being estimated. Nevertheless, major changes in the shape of the continental shelf and slope throughout the Cenozoic can be recognised, and mark some critical steps in the Ross Sea evolution. \v{Z}1. Pre-Miocene: the Eastern Ross Sea was a deep structural basin bordered to the west by areas \v{Z}e.g., the Central High. outcropping the sea level and hosting valley glaciers or small ice caps. A continental shelf edge was not clearly developed yet, the eastern flank of the Central High appeared as an inclined ramp, dipping towards the ocean. \v{Z}2. Early to middle Miocene: tectonic subsidence gradually produced a marine flooding over most of the pre-Miocene sub-aerial areas. A continental shelf, slope and rise are gradually delineated. The shelf profile was seaward dipping and not yet overdeepened. The geometry of the depositional sequences is mainly determined by eustacy, tectonic and sediment supply. \v{Z}3. Starting from Late Miocene \v{Z}likely from 10 Ma to at least 4 Ma. the bathymetric profile evolved progressively from seaward to landward dipping and reached an overdeepened configuration, very similar to the present-day profile. Depositional and erosional processes over the continental shelf were largely controlled by ice streams.},

In the present study high resolution (4\textendash 5 km) regional models of the Ross Sea and the West Antarctic Peninsula coastal ocean are used to compare differences in CDW transport. The models compared very well with observations from both regions. Examining the fluxes not only of heat, but also of a simulated ``dye'' representing CDW, shows that in both cases CDW crosses the shelf break in specific locations primarily determined by the bathymetry, but eventually floods much of the shelf. The frequency of intrusions in Marguerite Trough was ca. 2\textendash 3 per month, similar to recent mooring observations. A significant correlation between the along shelf break wind stress and the cross shelf break dye flux through Marguerite Trough was observed, suggesting that intrusions are at least partially related to short duration wind events.},

Recently, the IBCSO Project has combined its efforts with the Nippon Foundation \textendash{} GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project supporting the goal of mapping the world's oceans by 2030. New datasets initiated a second version of IBCSO (IBCSO v2). This version extends to 50\textdegree S (covering approximately 2.4 times the area of seafloor of the previous version) including the gateways of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic circumpolar frontal systems. Due to increased (multibeam) data coverage, IBCSO v2 significantly improves the overall representation of the Southern Ocean seafloor and resolves many submarine landforms in more detail. This makes IBCSO v2 the most authoritative seafloor map of the area south of 50\textdegree S.},

  abstract = {Limitations of access have long restricted exploration and investigation of the cavities beneath ice shelves to a small number of drillholes. Studies of sea-ice underwater morphology are limited largely to scientific utilization of submarines. Remotely operated vehicles, tethered to a mother ship by umbilical cable, have been deployed to investigate tidewater-glacier and ice-shelf margins, but their range is often restricted. The development of free-flying autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with ranges of tens to hundreds of kilometres enables extensive missions to take place beneath sea ice and floating ice shelves. Autosub2 is a 3600 kg, 6.7 m long AUV, with a 1600 m operating depth and range of 400 km, based on the earlier Autosub1 which had a 500 m depth limit. A single direct-drive d.c. motor and five-bladed propeller produce speeds of 1\textendash 2 m s\textendash 1. Rear-mounted rudder and stern-plane control yaw, pitch and depth. The vehicle has three sections. The front and rear sections are freeflooding, built around aluminium extrusion space-frames covered with glass-fibre reinforced plastic panels. The central section has a set of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic pressure vessels. Four tubes contain batteries powering the vehicle. The other three house vehicle-control systems and sensors. The rear section houses subsystems for navigation, control actuation and propulsion and scientific sensors (e.g. digital camera, upward-looking 300 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler, 200 kHz multibeam receiver). The front section contains forward-looking collision sensor, emergency abort, the homing systems, Argos satellite data and location transmitters and flashing lights for relocation as well as science sensors (e.g. twin conductivity\textendash temperature\textendash depth instruments, multibeam transmitter, subbottom profiler, AquaLab water sampler). Payload restrictions mean that a subset of scientific instruments is actually in place on any given dive. The scientific instruments carried on Autosub are described and examples of observational data collected from each sensor in Arctic or Antarctic waters are given (e.g. of roughness at the underside of floating ice shelves and sea ice).},

Spatial variations of low-density basin-fill thickness are estimated primarily using a 3D gravity inversion method that improves on previous modeling efforts by separating the effects of the low-density basin fill from the effects of pre-rift rocks. The basin is found to be significantly narrower\textemdash and more complex in the subsurface\textemdash than indicated or implied by previous modeling efforts. The basin is also estimated to be significantly shallower than previously estimated. Five distinct subbasins are recognized within the broader southern San Luis Basin. The oldest and shallowest subbasin is the Las Mesitas graben along the northwestern basin margin, formed during the Oligocene transition from Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic field magmatism to rifting. In this subbasin, sediments are estimated to reach a maximum thickness of \textasciitilde 400 m within a north\textendash south elongated structural depression. Other subbasins that likely initially developed during the Miocene are the dominant tectonic features in the southern San Luis Basin. This includes the Tres Orejas subbasin, which formed in the southwestern portion of the basin by the Embudo fault zone and a hypothesized fault zone along its western margin. This subbasin reaches a maximum thickness of \textasciitilde 2 km, as indicated by magnetotelluric and gravity modeling. The Sunshine Valley, Questa, and Taos subbasins occupy the eastern part of the southern San Luis Basin. The southern Sangre de Cristo fault zone is the dominant tectonic feature that controlled their development after \textasciitilde 20 Ma. The east-down Gorge fault zone controlled the western margins of significant parts of these eastern subbasins, although much of the Taos subbasin may be superimposed on the Tres Orejas subbasin. Maximum low-density basin-fill thicknesses are estimated to be 1.2 km for the Sunshine Valley subbasin, 800 m for the Questa subbasin, and 1.8 km for the Taos subbasin. Subbasin-forming tectonic activity along the Gorge fault zone and within the Tres Orejas subbasin ceased by the end of the development of the largely Pliocene Taos Plateau volcanic field. After that, rift-related subsidence became more narrowly centered on the eastern margin of the basin, controlled mainly by the linked Embudo and southern Sangre de Cristo fault zones.},

Over most of the 20th century, global mean sea level has risen mainly due to warming and subsequent expansion of the upper ocean layers as well as the melting of glaciers and ice caps. Over the last three decades, increased mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has also started to contribute significantly to contemporary sea-level rise. The future mass loss of the two ice sheets, which combined represent a sea-level rise potential of {$\sim$}65 m, constitutes the main source of uncertainty in long-term (centennial to millennial) sea-level rise projections. Improved knowledge of the magnitude and rate of future sea-level change is therefore of utmost importance. Moreover, sea level does not change uniformly across the globe and can differ greatly at both regional and local scales. The most appropriate and feasible sea level mitigation and adaptation measures in coastal regions strongly depend on local land use and associated risk aversion. Here, we advocate that addressing the problem of future sea-level rise and its impacts requires (i) bringing together a transdisciplinary scientific community, from climate and cryospheric scientists to coastal impact specialists, and (ii) interacting closely and iteratively with users and local stakeholders to co-design and co-build coastal climate services, including addressing the high-end risks.},

The thermocline adjacent in the sea adjacent to the glacier calving front (where ice is discharged) lowered by 250 meters in the austral summer of 2012. This change exposed the bottom of the ice shelf to colder surface waters rather than to the warmer, deeper layer, thereby reducing heat transfer from the ocean to the overlying ice and decreasing basal melting of the ice by more than 50\% compared to 2010. Those 2012 ocean conditions were partly caused by a strong La Ni\~na event, thus illustrating how important atmospheric variability is for regulating how the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to climate change.                        ,              Colder surface ocean waters decreased the rate of melting under the Pine Island Glacier ice shelf in 2012.           ,              Pine Island Glacier has thinned and accelerated over recent decades, significantly contributing to global sea-level rise. Increased oceanic melting of its ice shelf is thought to have triggered those changes. Observations and numerical modeling reveal large fluctuations in the ocean heat available in the adjacent bay and enhanced sensitivity of ice-shelf melting to water temperatures at intermediate depth, as a seabed ridge blocks the deepest and warmest waters from reaching the thickest ice. Oceanic melting decreased by 50\% between January 2010 and 2012, with ocean conditions in 2012 partly attributable to atmospheric forcing associated with a strong La Ni\~na event. Both atmospheric variability and local ice shelf and seabed geometry play fundamental roles in determining the response of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate.},

  abstract = {The stability of ice shelves and drainage of ice sheets they buttress is largely determined by melting at their atmospheric and oceanic interfaces. Subglacial bathymetry can impact ice shelf stability because it influences the onset and the pattern of warm ocean water incursions into the cavities between them and the seafloor. Bathymetry is further important at pinning points, which significantly retard the flow of ice shelves. This effect can be lost instantaneously if basal and surface melting cause an ice sheet to thin and lift off its pinning points. With all this in mind, we have developed a model of bathymetry beneath the western Roi Baudouin and central and eastern Borchgrevink ice shelves in Dronning Maud Land based on inversion from gravity data and tied to available depth references offshore and subglacial topography inland of the grounding line. The model shows deep glacial troughs beneath the ice shelves and bathymetric sills close to the continental shelf. The central Borchgrevink Ice Shelf overhangs the continental slope by around 50 km, exposing its northern parts to the open ocean and higher ocean temperatures. Continuous troughs traverse the central Borchgrevink and western Roi Baudouin ice shelves at depths greater than the offshore thermocline and thus present a risk of Warm Deep Water intrusions into their cavities under the current and future oceanographic regimes. Differing bathymetric characteristics might explain the ice shelves' contrasting dominant mass loss processes.},

  abstract = {Antarctica's ice shelves play a key role in stabilizing the ice streams that feed them. Since basal melting largely depends on ice-ocean interactions, it is vital to attain consistent bathymetry models to estimate water and heat exchange beneath ice shelves. We have constructed bathymetry models beneath the ice shelves of western Dronning Maud Land by inverting airborne gravity data and incorporating seismic, multibeam, and radar depth references. Our models reveal deep glacial troughs beneath the ice shelves and terminal moraines close to the continental shelf breaks, which currently limit the entry of Warm Deep Water from the Southern Ocean. The ice shelves buttress a catchment that comprises an ice volume equivalent to nearly 1 m of eustatic sea level rise, partly susceptible to ocean forcing. Changes in water temperature and thermocline depth may accelerate marine-based ice sheet drainage and constitute an underestimated contribution to future global sea level rise. Plain Language Summary The grounded ice sheets of Antarctica are stabilized by floating ice shelves. Any loss in ice shelf mass is matched by an increase in ice sheet drainage, which contributes to rising sea level. The ice shelves of western Dronning Maud Land are currently in balance with an inland ice volume that has the potential to raise global sea level by nearly 1 m. Ice shelves lose most of their mass from their bases when warm water intrudes from the surrounding ocean. The extent to which this occurs depends on the depth and shape of the seafloor beneath the ice shelves. We have modeled water depths beneath the ice shelves of Dronning Maud Land using airborne gravity data and depth measurements from seismic, multibeam, and radar data. Our bathymetric models show deep troughs beneath the ice shelves and shallow sills close to the continental shelf. These sills currently limit water mass exchange with Warm Deep Water from the Southern Ocean and so protect the ice shelves from significant melting at their bases. A changing climate with increasing ocean temperatures or a shallowing of warm water masses may increase ice shelf melting and lead to an increased sea level contribution.},

The patterns of these flow-related features reveal a history of discharge variations from the ice streams feeding the eastern part of the shelf.The most profound variations are visible in the track of rifts downstream of Crary Ice Rise, flow-stripe bends to the west of this ice rise and adjacent to Steershead ice rise, and changes in the northern margin of Ice Stream B. The track of rifts downstream of Crary Ice Rise indicates that the ice rise has existed for at least 700 years.The character of this track changes about 350 km downstream, indicating a rearrangement of flow patterns about 550 years ago. The large bulge in the flow stripes to the west of Crary Ice Rise is shown in detail, with bent flow stripes extending for several hundred kilometers along flow; this feature formed from the south, possibly due to a change in the discharge of Ice Stream A. The AVHRR image documents a complex history associated with the shutdown of Ice Stream C, with changes in the margins of Ice Stream C and the northern margin of Ice Stream B, and the grounding of Steershead ice rise with an associated bending and truncation of flow stripes. Landsat imagery shows a region that appears to be actively extending just downstream of the ice rise, as the shelf continues to respond to recent changes in ice-stream discharge. We present a four-stage flow history which accounts for the features preserved in the ice shelf.},

  abstract = {A new distribution of water and unconsolidated sediments in subglacial Lake Vostok, East Antarctica was developed via inversion of airborne gravity data constrained by 60 seismic soundings. A model was developed for host rock with a density of 2550 kg/m3 that was inferred from prior 2D modeling. Our 3D bathymetry model of Lake Vostok corresponds better with seismic data (RMS of 125 m) than two previous models based on the same gravity dataset. The good match in both water and sediment thicknesses between the gravity model and seismic measurements confirms two major facts about Lake Vostok: (1) the lake is hosted by sedimentary rocks, and (2) the bottom of the lake is covered with a layer of unconsolidated sediments that does not exceed 300 m in the southern basin and thickens almost to 400 m in the northern basin. Our new bathymetry model suggests much shallower water thicknesses (up to twice the previous estimates) in the middle and northern parts of the lake, while the water layer is thicker in the southern basin. Numerical modeling of the internal processes in the lake reveals the relevance of our new bathymetry model to the basal mass balance. A significant decrease in transport is observed in the shallower northern basin, as well as a decrease of 33\% in the turbulent kinetic energy. However, only minor differences were observed in the distribution of the calculated freezing and melting zones compared to previous models. Estimates for the sedimentation rates for six possible mechanisms were made. Possible sedimentation mechanisms are: (1) fluvial and periglacial, i.e. those that are active prior to the establishment of a large subglacial lake; (2) deposition due to overlying ice sheet, including melting out of the ice, as well as bulldozering by the overriding ice; and (3) suspended sediments from subglacial water flow including those deposited by periodical subglacial outbursts. The estimates for these mechanisms show that unconsolidated sediments of the observed thickness are most consistent with a lake that existed before glaciation.},

EAIS stability is most at risk in Wilkes Land across vast expanses of marine-based catchments including the 1400 km \texttimes{} 600 km expanse of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) region. Data from a recent regional aerogeophysical survey (Investigating the Cryospheric Evolution of the Central Antarctic Plate (ICECAP)/IceBridge) are combined with two historical surveys (Wilkes basin/Transantarctic Mountains System Exploration-Ice-house Earth: Stability or DYNamism? (WISE-ISODYN) and Wilkes Land Transect (WLK)) to improve our understanding of the vast subglacial sedimentary basins impacting WSB ice flow and geomorphology across geologic time. Analyzing a combination of gravity, magnetic and ice-penetrating radar data, we present the first detailed subglacial sedimentary basin model for the WSB that defines distinct northern and southern subbasin isopachs with average sedimentary basin thicknesses of 1144 m {$\pm$} 179 m and 1623 m {$\pm$} 254 m, respectively. Notably, more substantial southern subbasin sedimentary deposition in the WSB interior supports a regional Wilkes Land hypothesis that basin-scale ice flow and associated glacial erosion is dictated by tectonic basement structure and the inherited geomorphology of preglacial fluvial networks. Orbital, temperate/polythermal glacial cycles emanating from adjacent alpine highlands during the early Miocene to late Oligocene likely preserved critical paleoclimatic data in subglacial sedimentary strata. Substantially thinner northern WSB subglacial sedimentary deposits are generally restricted to fault-controlled, channelized basins leading to prominent outlet glacier catchments suggesting a more dynamic EAIS during the Pliocene.},

One of the key components of this research has been the mapping of Antarctic bed topography and ice thickness parameters that are crucial for modelling ice flow and hence for predicting future ice loss and ensuing sea level rise. Supported by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), the Bedmap3 Action Group aims not only to produce new gridded maps of ice thickness and bed topography for the international scientific community, but also to standardize and make available all the geophysical survey data points used in producing the Bedmap gridded products. Here, we document the survey data used in the latest iteration, Bedmap3, incorporating and adding to all of the datasets previously used for Bedmap1 and Bedmap2, including ice-bed, surface and thickness point data from all Antarctic geophysical campaigns since the 1950s. More specifically, we describe the processes used to standardize and make these and future survey and gridded datasets accessible under the \&lsquo;Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable\&rsquo; (FAIR) data principles. With the goals to make the gridding process reproducible and to allow scientists to re-use the data freely for their own analysis, we introduce the new SCAR Bedmap Data Portal ({$<$}a href="bedmap.scar.org" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}bedmap.scar.org{$<$}/a{$>$}, last access: 18 October 2022) created to provide unprecedented open access to these important datasets, through a user-friendly webmap interface. We believe that this data release will be a valuable asset to Antarctic research and will greatly extend the life cycle of the data held within it. Data are available from the UK Polar Data Centre: {$<$}a href="https://data.bas.ac.uk" target="\_blank" rel="noopener"{$>$}https://data.bas.ac.uk{$<$}/a{$>$}.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved datacoverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6 \% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10 \%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

The RES signal does not penetrate the marine ice, so the measurement is only to the meteoric-marine ice boundary, and therefore the difference between the two maps is the marine ice thickness. The marine ice is up to 190 m thick and accounts for about 9\% of the shelf volume.

This study collected hydrographic observations inside Ilulissat Icefjord and from adjacent Disko Bay between 2001 and 2014. The warmest deep Disko Bay waters were blocked by the entrance sill and did not reach Jakobshavn Glacier. In the fjord basin, the summer mean temperature was 2.88C from 2009 to 2013, excluding 2010, when it was 18C cooler. Despite this variability, summer potential densities in the basin were in the narrow range of 27.20 \# su \# 27.31 kg m23, and basin water properties matched those of Disko Bay in this layer each summer. This relation has likely held since at least 1980. Basin waters from 2009 and 2011\textendash 13 were therefore similar to those in 1998/99, when Jakobshavn Glacier began to retreat, while basin waters in 2010 were as cool as in the 1980s.

However, ocean bathymetry is challenging to measure within or close to ice-shelf cavities. It remains unclear how uncertainty in existing bathymetry datasets affect simulated sub-ice-shelf melt rates. Here we infer linear sensitivities of ice-shelf melt rates to bathymetric shape with grid-scale detail by means of the adjoint of an ocean general circulation model. Both idealized and realistic-geometry experiments of sub-ice-shelf cavities in West Antarctica reveal that bathymetry has a strong impact on melt in localized regions such as topographic obstacles to flow. Moreover, response of melt to bathymetric perturbation is found to be non-monotonic, with deepening leading to either increased or decreased melt depending on location. Our computational approach provides a comprehensive way of identifying regions, where refined knowledge of bathymetry is most impactful, and also where bathymetric errors have relatively little effect on modeled ice sheet-ocean interactions.},

However, spatial accuracy of modeled melt is not well investigated, and neither is the level of accuracy required to assess ice sheet loss. Focusing on a fast-thinning region of West Antarctica, we calculate spatially resolved ice-shelf melt from satellite altimetry and compare against results from an ocean model with varying representations of cavity geometry and ocean physics. Then, we use an ice-flow model to assess the impact of the results on grounded ice. We find that a number of factors influence model-data agreement of melt rates, with bathymetry being the leading factor; but this agreement is only important in isolated regions under the ice shelves, such as shear margins and grounding lines. To improve ice sheet forecasts, both modeling and observations of ice-ocean interactions must be improved in these critical regions.},

Our observational data are employed as primary inputs to a modelling procedure that first calculates the basal thermal regime of each glacier, then iterates the basal sliding coefficient and deformation rate parameter until the fit of simulated to observed surface velocities is optimized. We find that the two glaciers have both frozen and thawed areas at their beds, facilitating partial sliding. Glacier flow arises from a balance between sliding and deformation that fluctuates along the length of each glacier, with the amount of sliding typically varying by up to two orders of magnitude but with deformation rates far more constant. Beardmore Glacier is warmer and faster-flowing than Skelton Glacier, but an up-glacier deepening bed at the grounding line, coupled with ice thicknesses close to flotation, lead us to infer a greater vulnerability of Skelton Glacier to grounding-line recession if affected by ocean-forced thinning and concomitant acceleration.},

A twophase, one-dimensional hydrothermal model demonstrates the importance of groundwater flow in vertical heat flux advection near the ice-bed interface. Typical, conservative vertical components of groundwater volume fluxes (from either topographical gradients or vertically channeled flow) on the order of 61\textendash 10 mm/yr can alter vertical heat flux by 650\textendash 500 mW/m2 given parameters typical for the interior of East Antarctica. This heat flux has the potential to produce considerable volumes of meltwater depending on basin geometry and geothermal heat production. A one-dimensional hydromechanical model demonstrates that groundwater is mainly recharged into saturated, partially poroelastic (i.e., vertical stress only; not coupled to a deformation equation) sedimentary aquifers during ice advance. During ice retreat, groundwater discharges into the ice-bed interface, which may contribute to water budgets on the order of 0.1\textendash 1 mm/yr. We also present an estimated map of potentially heterogeneous heat flow provinces using radiogenic heat production data from East Antarctica and southern Australia, calculated sedimentary basin depths, and radar-derived bed roughness. These are overlaid together to delineate the areas of greatest potential effect from these modeled processes on the ice sheet dynamics of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.},

  abstract = {The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) are one of Earth's great mountain belts and are a fundamental physiographic feature of Antarctica. They are continental-scale, traverse a wide range of latitudes, have high relief, contain a significant proportion of exposed rock on the continent, and represent a major arc of environmental and geological transition. Although the modern physiography is largely of Cenozoic origin, this major feature has persisted for hundreds of millions of years since the Neoproterozoic to the modern. Its mere existence as the planet's longest intraplate mountain belt at the transition between a thick stable craton in East Antarctica and a large extensional province in West Antarctica is a continuing enigma. The early and more cryptic tectonic evolution of the TAM includes Mesoarchean and Paleoproterozoic crust formation as part of the Columbia supercontinent, followed by Neoproterozoic rift separation from Laurentia during breakup of Rodinia. Development of an Andean-style Gondwana convergent margin resulted in a long-lived Ross orogenic cycle from the late Neoproterozoic to the early Paleozoic, succeeded by crustal stabilization and widespread denudation during early Gondwana time, and intra-cratonic and foreland-basin sedimentation during late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic development of Pangea. Voluminous mafic volcanism, sill emplacement, and layered igneous intrusion are a primary signature of hotspot-influenced Jurassic extension during Gondwana breakup. The most recent phase of TAM evolution involved tectonic uplift and exhumation related to Cenozoic extension at the inboard edge of the West Antarctic Rift System, accompanied by Neogene to modern glaciation and volcanism related to the McMurdo alkaline volcanic province. Despite the remote location and relative inaccessibility of the TAM, its underlying varied and diachronous geology provides important clues for reconstructing past supercontinents and influences the modern flow patterns of both ice and atmospheric circulation, signifying that the TAM have both continental and global importance through time.},

  abstract = {Ice-shelf thickness is an important boundary condition for ice-sheet and sub-ice-shelf cavity modelling. It is required near the grounding line to calculate the ice flux used to determine ice-sheet mass balance by comparison with the upstream accumulation. In this mass budget approach, the accuracy of the ice thickness is one of the limiting factors in the calculation. We present a satellite retrieval of the ice thickness for all Antarctic ice shelves using satellite radar altimeter data from the geodetic phases of the European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS-1) during 1994\textendash 95 supplemented by ICESat data for regions south of the ERS-1 latitudinal limit. Surface elevations derived from these instruments are interpolated on to regular grids using kriging, and converted to ice thicknesses using a modelled firn-density correction. The availability of a new spatial variable firn-density correction significantly reduces the error in ice thickness as this was previously the dominant error source. Comparison to airborne data shows good agreement, particularly when compared to SOAR CASERTZ data on the largest ice shelves. Biases range from -13.0 m for areas where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down, to 53.4 m in regions where marine ice may be present.},

  abstract = {Antarctica's fast-flowing ice streams drain the ice sheet, with their velocity modulated by subglacial water systems. Current knowledge of these water systems is limited to the shallow portions near the ice-bed interface, but hypothesized deeper groundwater could also influence ice streaming. Here, we use magnetotelluric and passive seismic data from Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to provide the first observations of deep sub\textendash ice stream groundwater. Our data reveal a volume of groundwater within a {$>$}1-kilometer-thick sedimentary basin that is more than an order of magnitude larger than the known subglacial system. A vertical salinity gradient indicates exchange between paleo seawater at depth and contemporary basal meltwater above. Our results provide new constraints for subglacial water systems that affect ice streaming and subglacial biogeochemical processes.           ,              The deeper story                            Shallow, dynamic subglacial water systems provide lubrication that facilitates the movement of overlying ice.

Gustafson               et al               . show that the subglacial sediments beneath Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica are saturated with a mixture of fossil seawater and freshwater from the glacier (see the Perspective by Chu). This groundwater, extending downward for more than a kilometer, contains more than 10 times as much fluid volume as the shallow hydrologic system above and actively exchanges with it. Therefore, it has the potential to modulate ice streaming and subglacial biogeochemical reactions. \textemdash HJS                        ,              Fossil seawater mixes with basal melt in sediments underlying the Antarctic ice sheet.},

We provide an accessible critical review of the factors that influence computation time, highlighting problems in its reporting in current research and the negative practical impact that this has on developers, recommending best practice for its measurement and reporting. Discussing how computers and coders measure time, a discrepancy is exposed between best practice in the primarily theoretical field of computational complexity, and the difficulty for non-specialists in applying such theoretical findings. We therefore recommend establishing a better reporting practice, highlighting future work needed to expose the effects of poor reporting.

An important part of this effort is revising procedures for calculating gravity anomalies, taking into account our enhanced computational power, improved terrain databases and datums, and increased interest in more accurately defining long-wavelength anomaly components. Users of the databases may note minor differences between previous and revised database values as a result of these procedures. Generally, the differences do not impact the interpretation of local anomalies but do improve regional anomaly studies. The most striking revision is the use of the internationally accepted terrestrial ellipsoid for the height datum of gravity stations rather than the conventionally used geoid or sea level. Principal facts of gravity observations and anomalies based on both revised and previous procedures together with germane metadata will be available on an interactive Web-based data system as well as from national agencies and data centers. The use of the revised procedures is encouraged for gravity data reduction because of the widespread use of the global positioning system in gravity fieldwork and the need for increased accuracy and precision of anomalies and consistency with North American and national databases. Anomalies based on the revised standards should be preceded by the adjective ``ellipsoidal'' to differentiate anomalies calculated using heights with respect to the ellipsoid from those based on conventional elevations referenced to the geoid.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The recent rapid growth of rifts in the Brunt Ice Shelf appears to signal the onset of its largest calving event since records began in 1915. The aim of this study is to determine whether this calving event will lead to a new steady state in which the Brunt Ice Shelf remains in contact with the bed, or an unpinning from the bed, which could predispose it to accelerated flow or possible break-up. We use a range of geophysical data to reconstruct the sea-floor bathymetry and ice shelf geometry, to examine past ice sheet configurations in the Brunt Basin, and to define the present-day geometry of the contact between the Brunt Ice Shelf and the bed. Results show that during past ice advances grounded ice streams likely converged in the Brunt Basin from the south and east. As the ice retreated, it was likely pinned on at least three former grounding lines marked by topographic highs, and transverse ridges on the flanks of the basin. These may have subsequently formed pinning points for developing ice shelves. The ice shelf geometry and bathymetry measurements show that the base of the Brunt Ice Shelf now only makes contact with one of these topographic highs. This contact is limited to an area of less than 1.3 to 3\,km2 and results in a compressive regime that helps to maintain the ice shelf's integrity. The maximum overlap between ice shelf draft and the bathymetric high is 2\textendash 25\,m and is contingent on the presence of incorporated iceberg keels, which protrude beneath the base of the ice shelf. The future of the ice shelf depends on whether the expected calving event causes full or partial loss of contact with the bed and whether the subsequent response causes re-grounding within a predictable period or a loss of structural integrity resulting from properties inherited at the grounding line.},

Modelling studies have shown that where these surface expressions intersect the grounding line, they coincide with the likely outflow of subglacial water. An understanding of the initiation and the ice\textendash ocean evolution of the basal channels is required to understand the present behaviour and future dynamics of ice sheets and ice shelves. Here, we present focused active seismic and radar surveys of a basal channel, {$\sim$} 950 m wide and {$\sim$} 200 m high, and its upstream continuation beneath Support Force Glacier, which feeds into the Filchner Ice Shelf, West Antarctica. Immediately seaward from the grounding line, below the basal channel, the seismic profiles show an {$\sim$} 6.75 km long, 3.2 km wide and 200 m thick sedimentary sequence with chaotic to weakly stratified reflections we interpret as a grounding line fan deposited by a subglacial drainage channel directly upstream of the basal channel. Further downstream the seabed has a different character; it consists of harder, stratified consolidated sediments, deposited under different glaciological circumstances, or possibly bedrock. In contrast to the standard perception of a rapid change in ice shelf thickness just downstream of the grounding line, we find a flat topography of the ice shelf base with an almost constant ice thickness gradient along-flow, indicating only little basal melting, but an initial widening of the basal channel, which we ascribe to melting along its flanks.},

Further support for a recent grounding zone occupation comes from satellite imagery of sub-ice shelf channel features that likely originated at previous grounding-zone locations. These features begin 25 km seaward of the current grounding zone and cut across ice flow streak lines.

  abstract = {Abstract                            We calculate the present ice budget for Antarctica from measurements of accumulation minus iceberg calving, run-off and in situ melting beneath the floating ice shelves. The resulting negative mass balance of 469 Gt year               -1               differs substantially from other recent estimates but some components are subject to high temporal variability and budget uncertainties of 20\textendash 50\%. Annual accumulation from an earlier review is adjusted to include the Antarctic Peninsula for a total of 2144 Gt year               -1               . An iceberg production rate of 2016 Gt year               -1               is obtained from the volume of large icebergs calculated from satellite images since 1978, and from the results of an international iceberg census project. Ice-shelf melting of 544 Gt year               -1               is derived from physical and geochemical observations of meltwater outflow, glaciological field studies and modeling of the sub-ice ocean circulation. The highest melt rates occur near ice fronts and deep within sub-ice cavities. Run-off from the ice-sheet surface and from beneath the grounded ice is taken to be 53 Gt year               -1               . Less than half of the negative mass balance need come from the grounded ice to account for the unattributed 0.45 mm year               -1               in the IPCC ``best estimate'' of the recent global sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {An efficient random sampling method is introduced to estimate the contributions of several sources of uncertainty to prediction variance of (computer) models. Prediction uncertainty is caused by uncertainty about the initial state, parameters, unknown (e.g. future) exogenous variables, noises, etcetera. Such uncertainties are modelled here as random inputs into a deterministic model, which translates input uncertainty into output uncertainty. The goal is to pinpoint the major causes of output uncertainty. The method presented is particularly suitable for cases where uncertainty is present in a large number of inputs (such as future weather conditions). The expected reduction of output variance is estimated for the case that various (groups of) inputs should become fully determined. The method can be applied if the input sources fall into stochastically independent groups. The approach is more flexible than conventional methods based on approximations of the model. An agronomic example illustrates the method. A deterministic model is used to advise farmers on control of brown rust in wheat. Empirical data were used to estimate the distributions of uncertain inputs. Analysis shows that effective improvement of the precision of the model's prediction requires alternative submodels describing pest population dynamics, rather than better determination of initial conditions and parameters.},

  abstract = {Threats posed by the climate crisis have created an urgent need for sustainable green energy. Geothermal resources have the potential to provide up to 150\,GWe of sustainable energy by 2050. However, the key challenge in successfully locating and drilling geothermal wells is to understand how the heterogeneous structure of the subsurface controls the existence of exploitable fluid reservoirs. In this Review, we discuss how key geological factors contribute to the profitable utilization of intermediate-temperature to high-temperature geothermal resources for power generation. The main driver of geothermal activity is elevated crustal heat flow, which is focused in regions of active magmatism and/or crustal thinning. Permeable structures such as faults exercise a primary control on local fluid flow patterns, with most upflow zones residing in complex fault interaction zones. Major risks in geothermal resource assessment and operation include locating sufficient permeability for fluid extraction, in addition to declining reservoir pressure and the potential of induced seismicity. Advanced computational methods permit effective integration of multiple datasets and, thus, can reduce potential risks. Future innovations involve engineered geothermal systems as well as supercritical and offshore geothermal resources, which could greatly expand the global application of geothermal energy but require detailed knowledge of the respective geological conditions.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Rift System provides critical geological boundary conditions for the overlying West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Previous geophysical surveys have traced the West Antarctic Rift System and addressed the controls that it exerts on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in the Ross Sea Embayment. However, much less is known about the rift system under the Amundsen Sea Embayment, a key sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is thinning significantly today. New aerogravity data over the Pine Island Glacier region, one of the fastest flowing glaciers within the Amundsen Sea Embayment, sheds new light into the crustal structure under this dynamic part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Three-dimensional (3-D) inversion of terrain-decorrelated free-air and Bouguer gravity anomaly data reveal significant crustal thinning beneath the catchment of Pine Island Glacier. Under the Byrd Subglacial Basin and the newly identified Pine Island Rift, Moho depth is estimated to be 19 {$\pm$} 1 km. This is the thinnest crust observed beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Estimates of lithosphere rigidity (Te), based on isostatic models, yield a Te of 5 {$\pm$} 5 km, which is comparable to values from modern rift systems such as the Basin and Range Province. Major crustal thinning, coupled with low lithosphere rigidity, attest to the considerable impact of continental rifting beneath this part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. In analogy with the better known Ross Sea segment of the West Antarctic Rift System we suggest that the Amundsen Sea Embayment was affected by distributed Cretaceous rifting, followed by Cenozoic narrow-mode rifting. Narrow-mode rifting within the Pine Island Rift is particularly important as it may serve as a geological template for enhanced glacial flow associated with Pine Island Glacier.},

In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we identify three broad physiographic provinces and present their overlapping and interconnected tectonic, magmatic and sedimentary history. The Weddell Sea region, which lays furthest from the subducting margin, was most impacted by the Jurassic initiation of Gondwana break-up. Marie Byrd Land and the West Antarctic rift system developed as a broad Cretaceous to Cenozoic continental rift system, reworking a former convergent margin. Finally{$\mkern1mu$}, the Antarctic Peninsula and Thurston Island preserve an almost complete magmatic arc system. We conclude by briefly summarizing the geologic history of the West Antarctic system as a whole, how it provides insight into continental margin evolution and what key topics must be addressed by future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ice shelves play a critical role in the long-term stability of ice sheets through their buttressing effect. The underlying bathymetry and cavity thickness are key inputs for modelling future ice sheet evolution. However, direct observation of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry is time-consuming, logistically risky, and in some areas simply not possible. Here we use new compilations of airborne and marine gravity, radar depth sounding, and swath bathymetry to provide new estimates of sub-ice-shelf bathymetry outboard of the rapidly changing West Antarctic Thwaites Glacier and beneath the adjacent Dotson and Crosson ice shelves. This region is of special interest, as the low-lying inland reverse slope of the Thwaites Glacier system makes it vulnerable to marine ice sheet instability, with rapid grounding line retreat observed since 1993 suggesting this process may be underway. Our results confirm a major marine channel {$>$}800\,m deep extends tens of kilometres to the front of Thwaites Glacier, while the adjacent ice shelves are underlain by more complex bathymetry. Comparison of our new bathymetry with ice shelf draft reveals that ice shelves formed since 1993 comprise a distinct population where the draft conforms closely to the underlying bathymetry, unlike the older ice shelves, which show a more uniform depth of the ice base. This indicates that despite rapid basal melting in some areas, these recently floated parts of the ice shelf are not yet in dynamic equilibrium with their retreated grounding line positions and the underlying ocean system, a factor which must be included in future models of this region's evolution.},

However, the extensional basins of the Ross Sea are paradoxical in that positive gravity anomalies overlay the Victoria Land Basin, Northern Basin, Central Trough and Northern Central Trough while basement highs are associated with negative gravity anomalies. Measured basement densities from DSDP basement cores give values between 2600\textendash 2800 kg/m3 while bulk sediment densities range from 1210\textendash 2200 kg/m3, indicating a normal density relationship between basement and sediment infill. In contrast, the relatively young and narrow Terror Rift is associated with negative free-air and Bouguer gravity anomalies, but has a different geological history as compared to the larger Ross Sea basins. Process-oriented gravity modeling indicates that magmatic underplating and crustal intrusions are inconsistent with the observed gravity and basement geometry of the Ross Sea basins. The magma volume necessary to account for the distribution and amplitude of the positive gravity anomaly of the Central Basin and be isostatically balanced would need to be comparable to the tholeiitic flood basalt volume of the Columbia River province\textemdash it is thus unlikely that the volume of Neogene volcanics of the Ross Sea region is sufficient to explain the observed gravity relationship by modifying the bulk density of the crust.},

The dataset described here addresses these inconsistencies, including some novel interpolation schemes for sub ice-shelf cavities, and incorporates some major new datasets. The inclusion of new datasets is not exhaustive, this considerable task is left for the next release of BEDMAP, however, the data and procedure documented here provides another step forward and demonstrates the issues that need addressing in a continental scale dataset useful for high resolution ice sheet modelling.

The central Ross Sea underwent significant bathym\'etrie and oceanographic evolution with the inception of glaciomarine sedimentation, resulting in the sequential development of four contrasting foraminiferal populations (assemblage zones). Gradual climatic change in the Ross Sector during latest Paleogene-early Neogene time culminated in major ice build-up by the late early Miocene. Conclusions derived from our microfaunal studies reaffirm climatic and oceanographic trends interpreted from oxygen-isotope data for subAntarctic deep sea sites north of the Ross Sea. Intensification of glaciation within the Ross Sea area may be responsible for the increase in production of Antarctic Bottom Water and associated development of widespread early Neogene deep-sea hiatuses reported from lower latitude regions.},

  abstract = {To resolve the bed elevation of Antarctica, we present DeepBedMap \textendash{} a novel machine learning method that can produce Antarctic bed topography with adequate surface roughness from multiple remote sensing data inputs. The super-resolution deep convolutional neural network model is trained on scattered regions in Antarctica where high-resolution (250 m) ground-truth bed elevation grids are available. This model is then used to generate high-resolution bed topography in less surveyed areas. DeepBedMap improves on previous interpolation methods by not restricting itself to a low-spatial-resolution (1000 m) BEDMAP2 raster image as its prior image. It takes in additional high-spatialresolution datasets, such as ice surface elevation, velocity and snow accumulation, to better inform the bed topography even in the absence of ice thickness data from direct icepenetrating-radar surveys. The DeepBedMap model is based on an adapted architecture of the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network, chosen to minimize perpixel elevation errors while producing realistic topography. The final product is a four-times-upsampled (250 m) bed elevation model of Antarctica that can be used by glaciologists interested in the subglacial terrain and by ice sheet modellers wanting to run catchment- or continent-scale ice sheet model simulations. We show that DeepBedMap offers a rougher topographic profile compared to the standard bicubically interpolated BEDMAP2 and BedMachine Antarctica and envision it being used where a high-resolution bed elevation model is required.},

The West Antarctic samples from beneath the Whillans (B) and Kamb (C) ice streams are petrologically distinct from samples of lateral moraines flanking several East Antarctic outlet glaciers. The characteristic assemblage of four West Antarctic samples includes felsic intrusive and detrital sedimentary lithic fragments, plagioclase and abundant quartz. In contrast, most of the ten East Antarctic till samples contains abundant mafic intrusive and detrital sedimentary lithic fragments as well as less abundant quartz. The distinctive composition of these source areas can be linked to 33 samples from 20 cores of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) age till distributed across the Ross Sea. Western Ross Sea till samples exhibit mineralogic and lithological similarities to East Antarctic till samples, although these western Ross Sea tills contain higher percentages of felsic intrusive and extrusive lithic fragments. Eastern Ross Sea till samples are compositionally similar to West Antarctic till, particularly in their abundance of quartz and dearth of mafic and extrusive lithic components. Central Ross Sea till exhibits compositional similarities to both East and West Antarctic source terranes including a mafic lithic component, and marks the confluence of ice draining from East and West Antarctica during the LGM, thus West Antarctic-derived ice streams did not advance into the western Ross Sea. This indicates that even if pre-LGM equivalents of the present Siple Coast ice streams existed, they did not simply expand allowing West Antarctic-derived ice to dominate the LGM Ross Ice Sheet.},

First, it is well known now that gravity anomalies after the ``free-air'' correction are still located at their original positions. However, the ``free-air'' reduction was thought historically to relocate gravity from its observation position to the geoid (mean sea level). Such an understanding is a geodetic fiction, invalid and unacceptable in geophysics. Second, in gravity corrections and gravity anomalies, the elevation has been used routinely. The main reason is that, before the emergence and widespread use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), height above the geoid was the only height measurement we could make accurately (i.e., by leveling).},

The depocenters change markedly in the transitional phase at, or after, the Eocene/Oligocene boundary when the first major ice sheets reached the shelf.

In contrast, the adjacent Marie Byrd Land and Ellsworth-Whitmore mountains crustal blocks are on average over 1 km higher, with the former dominated by polygenetic shield and stratovolcanoes protruding through the West Antarctic ice sheet and the latter having a Precambrian basement. The upper mantle structure of these regions is important for inferring the geologic history and tectonic processes, as well as the influence of the solid earth on ice sheet dynamics. Yet this structure is poorly constrained due to a lack of seismological data. As part of the Polar Earth Observing Network, 13 temporary broadband seismic stations were deployed from January 2010 to January 2012 that extended from the Whitmore Mountains, across the West Antarctic Rift System, and into Marie Byrd Land with a mean station spacing of \textasciitilde 90 km. Relative P and S wave travel time residuals were obtained from these stations as well as five other nearby stations by cross correlation. The relative residuals, corrected for both ice and crustal structure using previously published receiver function models of crustal velocity, were inverted to image the relative P and S wave velocity structure of the West Antarctic upper mantle. Some of the fastest relative P and S wave velocities are observed beneath the Ellsworth-Whitmore mountains crustal block and extend to the southern flank of the Bentley Subglacial Trench. However, the velocities in this region are not fast enough to be compatible with a Precambrian lithospheric root, suggesting some combination of thermal, chemical, and structural modification of the lithosphere. The West Antarctic Rift System consists largely of relative fast uppermost mantle seismic velocities consistent with Late Cretaceous/early Cenozoic extension that at present likely has negligible rift related heat flow. In contrast, the Bentley Subglacial Trench, a narrow deep basin within the West Antarctic Rift System, has relative P and S wave velocities in the uppermost mantle that are \textasciitilde 1\% and \textasciitilde 2\% slower, respectively, and suggest a thermal anomaly of \textasciitilde 75 K. Models for the thermal evolution of a rift basin suggest that such a thermal anomaly is consistent with Neogene extension within the Bentley Subglacial Trench and may, at least in part, account for elevated heat flow reported at the nearby West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide Ice Core and at Subglacial Lake Whillans. The slowest relative P and S wave velocity anomaly is observed extending to at least 200 km depth beneath the Executive Committee Range in Marie Byrd Land, which is consistent with warm possibly plume-related, upper mantle. The imaged low-velocity anomaly and inferred thermal perturbation (\textasciitilde 150 K) are sufficient to support isostatically the anomalous long-wavelength topography of Marie Byrd Land, relative to the adjacent West Antarctic Rift System.},

In this study, we focus on the geothermal flux because it is the least wellknown component of the heat equation, and because it constrains the temperature at the bottom of the ice sheet. We used available geological data to build a map of the geothermal flux, which was found to increase from 51 mW/m2 in East Antarctica to 68 mW/ m2 in West Antarctica. These values were integrated in the computation of a basal temperature map. The available map of hydrological networks clearly shows more melted areas in West Antarctica than in the earlier results. So we suggest that the model should be forced with higher geothermal flux values, over 85 mW/m2 in this sector. This increase is in good agreement with published results which found a geothermal flux three times higher in West Antarctica. Finally, we computed the bottom melt rate over the ice sheet area which has a mean value of 3.5 mm/yr resulting in a lost of melted ice equal to 1\% of the total mass balance. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, interpretations of past ice sheet retreat over the last deglaciation in the Ross Embayment, Antarctica's largest catchment, differ considerably and imply either extremely high or very low sensitivity to environmental forcing. To investigate this, we perform regional ice sheet simulations using a wide range of atmosphere and ocean forcings. Constrained by marine and terrestrial geological data, these models predict earliest retreat in the central embayment and rapid terrestrial ice sheet thinning during the Early Holocene. We find that atmospheric conditions early in the deglacial period can enhance or diminish ice sheet sensitivity to rising ocean temperatures, thereby controlling the initial timing and spatial pattern of grounding-line retreat. Through the Holocene, however, grounding-line position is much more sensitive to subshelf melt rates, implicating ocean thermal forcing as the key driver of past ice sheet retreat.},

  abstract = {The role of external forcings in the deglacial ice sheet evolution of the Ross Embayment, Antarctica's largest catchment, continues to be a highly contested topic. Although numerical ice sheet models indicate that ocean and atmosphere forcings were the main drivers of deglacial ice sheet retreat, these models have difficulty in accurately capturing both the timing and rate of retreat in every area of the embayment. Other factors that influence the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate forcing, such as the physical properties of the bed, isostatic deformation of the continental shelf, and rheological properties of the ice, are parameterized inconsistently across models. Here, we explore using a systematic approach the extent to which specific model parameters related to basal substrate, bed deformation and ice flow and rheology impact the climate sensitivity of the ice sheet in the Ross Embayment over the last deglaciation. Higher variability in deglacial ice sheet evolution is observed among experiments using different model parameters than among experiments using different climate forcings. Mantle viscosity, the material properties of the till, and an enhancement factor of the shallow shelf approximation (ESSA) component of the stress balance exhibit strong influences on the timing of ice sheet response to deglacial climate forcing, and may contribute to the asynchronous retreat behavior of the Eastern and Western Ross Sea. The Western Ross Sea is especially sensitive to both climate forcing and model parameter selection, with both cool climate forcing and low ESSA producing better agreement with terrestrial ice thinning records. The evolution and extent of the Siple Coast grounding line is highly sensitive to the mantle viscosity and till properties in addition to ocean and precipitation forcing. Constraining these physical model parameters is therefore paramount for accurate projections of the Antarctic ice sheet response to projected future changes in ocean temperatures and precipitation.},

  abstract = {The far eastern continental shelf of the Ross Sea, Antarctica, has been relatively unexplored up to now. This region and western Marie Byrd Land are at the eastern limit of the Ross Sea rift, part of the West Antarctic rift system, one of the larger regions of extended crust in the world. The Ross Sea continental shelf west of Cape Colbeck and the Edward VII Peninsula in western Marie Byrd Land was investigated using marine geophysics during cruise 9601 of the research vessel ice breaker Nathaniel B. Palmer. The purpose was to determine the structural framework and tectonic history of the eastern border of the Ross Sea rift and to integrate this with what is known about western Marie Byrd Land. The region mapped is characterized by a passive margin with a flat overdeepened shelf cut by the north trending Colbeck Trough, an erosional feature formed in Miocene and later time by glacial downcutting that followed the locations of existing basement structures. Seismic sequences and unconformities identified in the Ross Sea were correlated into the Colbeck shelf area. The section comprises mostly undeformed glacial marine sequences of late Oligocene and younger age that are unconformably overlying late Early to Late Cretaceous and minor early Tertiary (?) faulted sequences. This unconformity is identified as RSU6, mapped elsewhere in the eastern Ross Sea. Two units are found below RSU6, each separated by an unconformity that is here named RSU7. These sequences fill north trending half grabens in the faulted basement and are interpreted as syn rift units. Unconformity RSU7 is correlated to the West Antarctic Erosion Surface mapped onshore in western Marie Byrd Land. The lack of thick early Tertiary sediments on the shelf suggests significant vertical tectonics. This onshore and offshore region was widely faulted in late Early and Late Cretaceous time, was high above sea level and was beveled by prolonged erosion, while subsiding steadily in Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic time. Subsidence was largely due to lithosphere cooling amplified later by glacial and sediment loading in Cenozoic time. Mylonites that have late Early Cretaceous cooling ages were dredged from the southeast wall of the Colbeck Trough. This finding and normal faults that we mapped in the eastern Ross Sea we attribute to detachment-style extension in late Early Cretaceous time. This extension was directed subparallel to the trend of the present margin edge and occurred prior to the rifting of Campbell Plateau from Marie Byrd Land at {$\sim$}79 Ma. Cooling events onshore western Marie Byrd Land suggest the main extension began at {$\sim$}105 Ma. This is also the time of transition from subduction to extension elsewhere along the ancient Gondwana margin. Minor west tilting of the shelf during the late Cenozoic was the result of continued subsidence of the continental shelf along with possible uplift of western Marie Byrd Land associated with the Marie Byrd Land dome to the east. Early Tertiary extension in the western Ross Sea rift is not strongly reflected in the east side of the rift. A more robust correlation of the events here with the better known tectonic history on the west side of the Ross Sea rift awaits sampling and dating of the units we mapped on the Colbeck shelf.},

  abstract = {Measurements of ice thickness on the Antarctic ice sheet collected during surveys undertaken over the past 50 years have been brought together into a single database. From these data, a seamless suite of digital topographic models have been compiled for Antarctica and its surrounding ocean. This includes grids of ice sheet thickness over the grounded ice sheet and ice shelves, water column thickness beneath the floating ice shelves, bed elevation beneath the grounded ice sheet, and bathymetry to 60\textdegree S, including the sub-ice-shelf cavities. These grids are consistent with a recent high-resolution surface elevation model of Antarctica. While the digital models have a nominal spatial resolution of 5 km, such high resolution is justified by the original data density only over a few parts of the ice sheet. The suite does, however, provide an unparalleled vision of the geosphere beneath the ice sheet and a more reliable basis for ice sheet modeling than earlier maps. The total volume of the Antarctic ice sheet calculated from the BEDMAP grid is 25.4 million km3, and the total sea level equivalent, derived from the amount of ice contained within the grounded ice sheet, is 57 m, comprising 52 m from the East Antarctic ice sheet and 5 m from the West Antarctic ice sheet, slightly less than earlier estimates. The gridded data sets can be obtained from the authors.},

  abstract = {We have developed a gravity-inversion method for simultaneously estimating the 3D basement relief of a sedimentary basin and the parameters defining a presumed parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth in a sedimentary pack, assuming prior knowledge about the basement depth at a few points. The sedimentary pack is approximated by a grid of 3D vertical prisms juxtaposed in both horizontal directions of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To estimate the parameters defining the parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth and to produce stable depth-to-basement estimates, we imposed smoothness on the basement depths and proximity between estimated and known depths at boreholes. We applied our method to synthetic data from a simulated complex 3D basement relief with two sedimentary sections having distinct parabolic laws describing the density-contrast variation with depth. The results provide good estimates of the true parameters of the parabolic law of density-contrast decay with depth and of the basement relief. Inverting the gravity data from the onshore and part of the shallow offshore Almada Basin on Brazil's northeastern coast shows good correlation with known structural features.},

  abstract = {Locally grounded features in ice shelves, called ice rises and rumples, play a key role buttressing discharge from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and regulating its contribution to sea level. Ice rises typically rise several hundreds of meters above the surrounding ice shelf; shelf flow is diverted around them. On the other hand, shelf ice flows across ice rumples, which typically rise only a few tens of meters above the ice shelf. Ice rises contain rich histories of deglaciation and climate that extend back over timescales ranging from a few millennia to beyond the last glacial maximum. Numerical model results have shown that the buttressing effects of ice rises and rumples are significant, but details of processes and how they evolve remain poorly understood. Fundamental information about the conditions and processes that cause transitions between floating ice shelves, ice rises and ice rumples is needed in order to assess their impact on ice-sheet behavior. Targeted high-resolution observational data are needed to evaluate and improve prognostic numerical models and parameterizations of the effects of small-scale pinning points on grounding-zone dynamics.},

  abstract = {Geological constraints on the timing of retreat of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) Antarctic Ice Sheets provide critical insights into the processes controlling marine-based ice-sheet retreat. The overdeepened, landward-sloping bathymetry of Antarctica's continental shelves is an ideal configuration for marine ice-sheet instability, with the potential for past and future ice-sheet collapse and accelerated sea-level rise. However, the chronology of retreat of the LGM ice sheet in the Ross Sea is largely constrained by imprecise radiocarbon chronology of bulk marine sediments or by coastal records that offer more reliable dating techniques but which may be influenced by local piedmont glaciers derived from East Antarctic outlet glaciers. Consequently, these coastal records may be ambiguous in the broader context of retreat in the central regions of the Ross Sea. Here, we present a sedimentary facies succession and foraminifera-based radiocarbon chronology from within the Ross Sea embayment that indicates glacial retreat and open-marine conditions to the east of Ross Island before 8.6 cal. (calibrated) kyr B.P., at least 1 k.y. earlier than indicated by terrestrial records in McMurdo Sound. Comparing these data to new modeling experiments, we hypothesize that marine-based ice-sheet retreat was triggered by oceanic forcings along most of the Pacific Ocean coastline of Antarctica, but continued Holocene retreat into the inner shelf region of the Ross Sea occurred primarily as a consequence of bathymetric controls on marine ice-sheet instability.},

  abstract = {Getz Ice Shelf, the largest producer of ice shelf meltwater in Antarctica, buttresses glaciers that hold enough ice to raise sea level by 22 cm. We present a new bathymetry of its sub-ice shelf cavity using a three-dimensional inversion of airborne gravity data constrained by multibeam bathymetry at sea and a reconstruction of the bedrock from mass conservation on land. The new bathymetry is deeper than previously estimated with differences exceeding 500 m in a number of regions. When incorporated into an ocean model, it yields a better description of the spatial distribution of ice shelf melt, specifically along glacier grounding lines. While the melt intensity is overestimated because of a positive bias in ocean thermal forcing, the study reveals the main pathways along which warm oceanic water enters the cavity and corroborates the observed rapid retreat of Berry Glacier along a deep channel with a retrograde bed slope. Plain Language Summary The Getz Ice Shelf is a major ice shelf in West Antarctica that is rapidly melting. Its exposure to warm oceanic water has made it the largest producer of ice shelf meltwater in Antarctica. To understand its evolution and the impact on sea level rise of the glaciers that flow into it, it is essential to obtain a better description of the bathymetry beneath its hundreds of meters of floating ice. We use a combination of airborne gravity and other data to infer the depth of the cavity. We find the seabed to be in several regions more than 500 m deeper than previously reported, hence revealing one of the deepest ice shelf cavities in West Antarctica. When used in combination with an ocean model, the bathymetry helps to better explain the spatial variability in melt observed from remote sensing data, the pathways for warm waters to reach the ice shelf, and the recent evolution of selected glaciers.},

  abstract = {Traditional methods of deriving temporal variability of Antarctic ice-shelf elevation from satellite altimetry use a fixed (``Eulerian'') reference frame, where the measured changes include advection of ice thickness gradients between measurement epochs. We present a new method which removes advection effects by using an independent velocity field to compare elevations in a moving (``Lagrangian'') reference frame. Applying the technique to ICESat laser altimetry for the period 2003\textendash 2009 over the two largest Antarctic ice shelves, Ross and Filchner-Ronne, we show that the Lagrangian approach reduces the variability of derived elevation changes by about 50\% compared to the Eulerian approach and reveals clearer spatial patterns of elevation change. The method simplifies the process of estimating basal mass budget from the residual of all other processes that contribute to ice-shelf elevation changes. We use field data and ICESat measurements over ice rises and the grounded ice sheet to account for surface accumulation and changes in firn air content, and remove the effect of ice-flow divergence using surface velocity and ice thickness data. The results show highest basal melt rates ({$>$}5 m a\`A1) near the deep grounding lines of major ice streams, but smaller melt rates ({$<$}5 m a\`A1) near the ice-shelf fronts are equally important to total meltwater production since they occur over larger areas. Integrating over the entire ice-shelf areas, we obtain basal mass budgets of \`A50 {$\pm$} 64 Gt a\`A1 for Ross and \`A124 {$\pm$} 66 Gt a\`A1 for Filchner-Ronne, with changes in firn air content as the largest error source.},

  abstract = {Surface ice velocity is a fundamental characteristic of glaciers and ice sheets that quantifies the transport of ice. Changes in ice dynamics have a major impact on ice sheet mass balance and its contribution to sea level rise. Prior comprehensive mappings employed speckle and feature tracking techniques, optimized for fast-flow areas, with precision of 2-5 m/year, hence limiting our ability to describe ice flow in the slow interior. We present a vector map of ice velocity using the interferometric phase from multiple satellite synthetic aperture radars resulting in 10 times higher precision in speed (20 cm/year) and direction (5\textdegree ) over 80\% of Antarctica. Precision mapping over areas of slow motion ({$<$}1 m/year) improves from 20 to 93\%, which helps better constrain drainage boundaries, improve mass balance assessment, evaluate regional atmospheric climate models, reconstruct ice thickness, and inform ice sheet numerical models. Plain Language Summary We present a new map of Antarctic ice velocity that is 10 times more precise than prior maps and reveals ice motion at a high precision over 80\% of the continent versus 20\% in the past.

Most data constraining these models originate from the Ross Sea/Adare Trough area and the Transantarctic Mountains. We use a new Antarctic continental crustal-thinning grid, combined with a revised plate-kinematic model based on East Antarctic \textendash{} Australia \textendash{} Pacific \textendash{} West Antarctic plate circuit closure, to trace the geometry and extensional style of the Eocene \textendash{} Oligocene West Antarctic Rift from the Ross Sea to the South Shetland Trench.

Seismic-reflection profiles crossing the De Gerlache Gravity Anomaly, a tectonic scar from a former spreading ridge jump in the Bellingshausen Sea, suggest Late Tertiary reactivation in a dextral strike-slip mode. This is supported by seismic-reflection profiles crossing the De Gerlache Gravity Anomaly in the Bellingshausen Sea, which show incised narrow sediment troughs and vertical faults indicating strike-slip movement along a north \textendash{} south direction. Using pre-48 Ma plate circuit closure, we test the hypothesis that the Lord Howe Rise was attached to the Pacific Plate during the opening of the Tasman Sea.

  abstract = {Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica, has been experiencing acceleration in its flow speed and mass loss for nearly two decades, driven in part by an increase in the delivery of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). However, at present, the configuration of the sub-ice-shelf cavity and bed conditions beneath the PIG ice shelf that dictate such oceanic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we use aerogravity data and ocean bottom depths measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to model the bathymetry and sediment layer thickness beneath the PIG ice shelf. Results reveal that the deep basins, previously found by AUV on both landward and seaward sides of a submarine ridge, extend substantially to the north and south. The water column thickness of the basins reaches 400\textendash 550 m on the landward side of the ridge and 500\textendash 600 m on the seaward side. The sediment layer covers the whole expanse of the seabed beneath the ice shelf, and the thickness is in the range \$200\textendash 1000 m. The thinnest sediments ({$<$}200 m) are found on the seaward slope of the submarine ridge, suggesting that erosion by advancing ice may have been concentrated in the lee of the topographic high.},

  abstract = {Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing mass and contributing to global sea-level rise at an accelerating rate. Although recent observations and modeling have identified the incursion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) beneath the PIG ice shelf (PIGIS) as the main driver of this ice-mass loss, the lack of precise bathymetry limits furthering our understanding of the ice\textendash ocean interactions and improving the accuracy of modeling. Here we present updated bathymetry and sediment distribution beneath the PIGIS, modeled by the inversion of aerogravity data with constraints from active-source seismic data, observations from an autonomous underwater vehicle, and the regional gravity-anomaly field derived from satellite gravity observations. Modeled bathymetry shows a submarine ridge beneath the middle of PIGIS that rises {$\sim$}350 to 400 m above the surrounding sea floor, with a minimum water-column thickness of {$\sim$}200 m above it. This submarine ridge continues across the whole width of the 45-km wide ice shelf, with no deep troughs crossing it, confirming the general features of the previously predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. However, the relatively low resolution of the aerogravity data and limitations in our inversion method leave a possibility that there is an undetected, few-kilometerswide or narrower trough that may alter the predicted sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation. Modeled sediment distribution indicates a sedimentary basin of up to {$\sim$}800 m thick near the current grounding zone of the main PIG trunk and extending farther inland, and a region seaward of the submarine ridge where sediments are thin or absent with exposed crystalline basement that extends seaward into Pine Island Bay. Therefore, the submarine ridge marks the transition from a thick sedimentary basin providing a smooth interface over which ice could flow easily by sliding or sediment deformation, to a region with no to little sediments and instead a rough interface over which ice flows mainly by deformation. We hypothesize that the post-Last Glacial Maximum retreat of PIG stabilized at this location because of the spatial transition in basal conditions. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the recent retreat of PIG was strongly forced, probably by changes in ocean circulation, rather than occurring because of ongoing response to the end of the ice age or other changes inland of or beneath PIG.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Knowledge of past ice sheet configurations is useful for informing projections of future ice sheet dynamics and for calibrating ice sheet models. The topology of grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica has been much debated, but it has generally been assumed that the modern ice sheet is as small as it has been for more than 100\,000~years (Conway et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2017; Lowry et al., 2019; McKay et al., 2016; Scherer et al., 1998). Recent findings suggest that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet~(WAIS) grounding line retreated beyond its current location earlier in the Holocene and subsequently readvanced to reach its modern position (Bradley et al., 2015; Kingslake et al., 2018). Here, we further constrain the post-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) grounding line retreat and readvance in the Ross Sea sector using a two-phase model of radiocarbon input and decay in subglacial sediments from six sub-ice sampling locations. In addition, we reinterpret high basal temperature gradients, measured previously at three sites in this region (Engelhardt, 2004), which we explain as resulting from recent ice shelf re-grounding accompanying grounding line readvance. At one location \textendash{} Whillans Subglacial Lake~(SLW) \textendash{} for which a sediment porewater chemistry profile is known, we estimate the grounding line readvance by simulating ionic diffusion. Collectively, our analyses indicate that the grounding line retreated over SLW 4300-2500+1500~years ago, and over sites on Whillans Ice Stream~(WIS), Kamb Ice Stream~(KIS), and Bindschadler Ice Stream~(BIS) 4700-2300+1500, 1800-700+2700, and 1700-600+2800 years ago, respectively. The grounding line only recently readvanced back over those sites 1100-100+200, 1500-200+500, 1000-300+200, and 800{$\pm$}100~years ago for SLW, WIS, KIS, and BIS, respectively. The timing of grounding line retreat coincided with a warm period in the mid-Holocene to late Holocene. Conversely, grounding line readvance is coincident with cooling climate in the last 1000\textendash 2000~years. Our estimates for the timing of grounding line retreat and readvance are also consistent with relatively low carbon-to-nitrogen ratios measured in our subglacial sediment samples (suggesting a marine source of organic matter) and with the lack of grounding zone wedges in front of modern grounding lines. Based on these results, we propose that the Siple Coast grounding line motions in the mid-Holocene to late Holocene were primarily driven by relatively modest changes in regional climate, rather than by ice sheet dynamics and glacioisostatic rebound, as hypothesized previously (Kingslake et al., 2018).},

  abstract = {Developments in instrumentation, data collection, computer performance, and visualisation have been catalysts for significant advances in modelling and inversion of geophysical data. Forward modelling, which is fundamental to intuitive geological understanding and practical inversion methods, has progressed from representations using simple 3D models to whole earth models using voxels and discrete surfaces. Inversion has achieved widespread acceptance as a valid interpretation tool and major progress has been made by integrating geological models as constraints for both voxel and multi-body parametric methods. As a consequence, potential field, IP and electromagnetic inversion methods have become an essential part of most mineral exploration programs. In this paper we summarize some of the progress made over the last decade for each of these data types. Inversion applications are divided into three categories: (a) Type I (discrete body), (b) Type II (pure property) and (c) Type III (lithologic). Potential field inversions are the most advanced and thus most commonly used. 3D DC resistivity and IP inversions are becoming more prevalent. 3D EM inversions, in both time and frequency domains, are just emerging. Inversion examples are drawn from a number of groups and over different geological targets. However, we make extensive use of the geophysical data set from San Nicolas, since 3D inversions of all data types have been carried out there. The paper is essentially non-mathematical but we have incorporated some generic detail regarding how the inversions are carried out and the computations needed. We conclude the paper with our views of where research will be focused for the next decade and also provide our assessment of the challenges that the industry must address to make maximum use of inversion methodologies.},

The method readily handles large numbers of model points, and it is found empirically that convergence of the iteration can be assured by application of a low-pass filter. The nonuniqueness of the inversion can be characterized by two free parameters: the assumed density contrast between the two media, and the level at which the inverted topography is calculated. Additional geophysical knowledge is required to reduce this ambiguity. The inversion of a gravity profile perpendicular to a continental margin to find the location of the Moho is offered as a practical example of this method.},

  abstract = {The gravity anomaly is defined as the difference between the Earth's gravity on the geoid and the normal gravity on the reference ellipsoid. Because these quantities are not at the same point, the anomaly contains centrifugal accelerations and cannot be considered a harmonic function. The gravity disturbance is the difference between gravity and normal gravity at the same point. Consequently, the centrifugal effects can be neglected and the disturbance can be considered a harmonic function. This is the premise behind most potential-field data processing techniques (e.g., upward/downward continuation). Unlike the anomaly, the disturbance is due solely to the gravitational effects of geologic sources, making it the most appropriate for geophysical purposes. Use of the gravity anomaly in geophysics carries with it the implicit assumption that it is a good approximation for the gravity disturbance. However, bear in mind that the difference between the gravity disturbance and the free-air anomaly can be larger than 10 mGal worldwide. In fact, we argue that the assumptions made during gravity forward and inverse modeling imply that the quantity being modeled is the disturbance, not the anomaly.},

  abstract = {Ice losses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have accelerated since the 1990s, accounting for a significant increase in the global mean sea level. Here, we present a new 29-year record of ice sheet mass balance from 1992 to 2020 from the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE). We compare and combine 50 independent estimates of ice sheet mass balance derived from satellite observations of temporal changes in ice sheet flow, in ice sheet volume, and in Earth's gravity field. Between 1992 and 2020, the ice sheets contributed 21.0 {$\pm$} 1.9 mm to global mean sea level, with the rate of mass loss rising from 105 Gt yr-1 between 1992 and 1996 to 372 Gt yr-1 between 2016 and 2020. In Greenland, the rate of mass loss is 169 {$\pm$} 9 Gt yr-1 between 1992 and 2020, but there are large inter-annual variations in mass balance, with mass loss ranging from 86 Gt yr-1 in 2017 to 444 Gt yr-1 in 2019 due to large variability in surface mass balance. In Antarctica, ice losses continue to be dominated by mass loss from West Antarctica (82 {$\pm$} 9 Gt yr-1) and, to a lesser extent, from the Antarctic Peninsula (13 {$\pm$} 5 Gt yr-1). East Antarctica remains close to a state of balance, with a small gain of 3 {$\pm$} 15 Gt yr-1, but is the most uncertain component of Antarctica's mass balance.

  abstract = {The lithospheric structure of Antarctica is still underexplored. Moho depth estimate studies are in disagreement by more than 10 km in several regions, including, for example, the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains. Taking account the sparseness of seismological stations and the nonuniqueness of potential field methods, inversions of Moho depth are performed here based on satellite gravity data in combination with currently available seismically constrained Moho depth estimates. Our results confirm that a lower density contrast at the Moho is present under East Antarctica than beneath West Antarctica. A comparison between the Moho depth derived from our inversion and an Airy-isostatic Moho model also reveals a spatially variable buoyancy contribution from the lithospheric mantle beneath contrasting sectors of East Antarctica. Finally, to test the plausibility of different Moho depths scenarios for the Transantarctic Mountains-Wilkes Subglacial Basin system, we present 2-D lithospheric models along the Trans-Antarctic Mountain Seismic Experiment/Gamburtsev Mountain Seismic experiment seismic profile. Our models show that if a moderately depleted lithospheric mantle of inferred Proterozoic age underlies the region, then a shallower Moho is more likely beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. If however, refertilization processes occurred in the upper mantle, for example, in response to Ross-age subduction, then a deeper Moho scenario is preferred. We conclude that 3-D lithospheric modeling, coupled with the availability of new seismic information in the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains, is required to help resolve this controversy, thereby also reducing the ambiguities in geothermal heat flux estimation beneath this key part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Plain Language Summary Antarctica is a vast and remote continent that is mostly buried beneath the largest ice sheets left on Earth. Consequently, its deep structure is still poorly known, despite its importance as the cradle on which the overlying ice sheets flow. By studying anomalies in the gravitational field of the Earth as measured by satellites and using independent constraints derived by measuring seismic wave travel times from distant earthquakes, we investigate the variations in the depth of the boundary between Earth's crust and mantle (known as the Moho) beneath Antarctica. Our models confirm that the older cratonic regions of East Antarctica have generally deeper Moho compared to the younger geological provinces of West Antarctica. They also highlight that large regions of East Antarctica may exhibit contrasting mantle characteristics, and this lends further weight to recent geological and geophysical studies, indicating that East Antarctica is composed of different Precambrian provinces. In our study we re-evaluated in particular two Moho depth scenarios derived from previous seismic studies for the hinterland of the Transantarctic Mountains, where the enigmatic Wilkes Subglacial Basin lies. We show that if an old Precambrian mantle is assumed, then a thin crust scenario beneath the basin is more likely, but if the mantle has been in part modified by more recent (ca. 500 Ma old) subduction, then a thicker crust scenario would become more viable. Overall, our study calls for combining gravity, seismological, and petrological modeling for enhanced Antarctic lithosphere and isostatic studies.},

Our structural analysis of deformation in the Liv Group, a sequence of Cambrian volcanic, volcaniclastic, clastic and carbonate rocks, and nearby plutonic rocks indicates that the Shackleton Glacier area has a polyphase deformation history that includes development of both contractional and strike-slip structures. We describe evidence for synchronous contraction and strike-slip movement, and suggest that the structural suite in this area developed, at least in part, within a sinistral transpressive kinematic regime. Deformation in the Shackleton Glacier area is inferred to be at least in part younger than 505 Ma, based on the deformation of the well-dated Taylor Formation. New 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages from metamorphosed igneous and sedimentary rocks range from c. 500 to 470 Ma and are interpreted to date orogenic cooling. Based on our structural results, and on consideration of the tectonic environment represented by the Liv Group, we propose that shortening across a subduction-related volcanic arc system caused deformation of the Liv Group and associated plutonic rocks. Oblique convergence and thus, transpression, may have ultimately been related to left-oblique plate subduction.},

However, other than a preliminary attempt to reconstruct Antarctic topography at the Eocene\textendash Oligocene boundary, the long-term evolution of Antarctica's subglacial topography throughout its glacial history has not previously been quantified. Here, we derive new reconstructions of Antarctic topography for four key time slices in Antarctica's climate and glacial history: the Eocene\textendash Oligocene boundary (ca. 34 Ma), the Oligocene\textendash Miocene boundary (ca. 23 Ma), the mid-Miocene climate transition (ca. 14 Ma), and the midPliocene warm period (ca. 3.5 Ma). To reconstruct past topography, we consider a series of processes including ice sheet loading, volcanism, thermal subsidence, horizontal plate motion, erosion, sedimentation and flexural isostatic adjustment, and validate our models where possible using onshore and offshore geological constraints. Our reconstructions show that the land area of Antarctica situated above sea level was \textasciitilde 25\% larger at the Eocene\textendash Oligocene boundary than at the present-day. Offshore sediment records and terrestrial constraints indicate that the incision of deep subglacial topographic troughs around the margin of East Antarctica occurred predominantly in the Oligocene and early Miocene, whereas in West Antarctica erosion and sedimentation rates accelerated after the midMiocene. Changes to the topography after the mid-Pliocene were comparatively minor. Our new palaeotopography reconstructions provide a critical boundary condition for models seeking to understand past behaviour of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and have implications for estimating changes in global ice volume, temperature, and sea level across major Cenozoic climate transitions.},

Our results show that maximum global ice volume occurred during two late Oligocene d18O events, Oi2c (24.4 Ma) and Mi1 (23.0 Ma) (inferred glacioeustatic lowering), with volumes up to \textasciitilde 25\% greater than the present-day East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Ice volume during glacial minima was on the order of about 50\% of the present-day EAIS. This is supported by late Oligocene stratigraphic records from Antarctica that contain evidence of cold climates and repeated episodes of glaciation at sea level and grounding lines of glacial ice on the Antarctic continental shelf in the Ross Sea and Prydz Bay. In contrast, composite deep-sea d18O records show a significant decrease (z 1x) between 26.7 and 23.5 Ma, which have long been interpreted as bottom-water warming combined with deglaciation of Antarctica. However, a close examination of individual d18O records indicates a clear divergence after 26.8 Ma between records from Southern Ocean locations (i.e., Ocean Drilling Program Sites 689, 690, 744) and those of other ocean basins. High d18O values (2.9x\textendash 3.3x) from these Southern Ocean d18O records are consistent with an ice sheet on the East Antarctic continent equivalent to present-day values and cold bottom-water temperatures (V 2.0 8C). These differences suggest a reduction in deep-water produced near the Antarctic continent (i.e., proto-Antarctic Bottom Water, proto-AABW), which were quickly entrained and mixed with warmer (and presumably more saline) bottom-water originating from lower latitudes. Expansion of a warmer deep-water mass and the weakening of the proto-AABW may explain the large intrabasinal isotopic gradients that developed among late Oligocene benthic d18O records. These conclusions are also supported by ocean modeling suggesting a reduction of deep-water formed in the Southern Ocean, strengthening of deep-water from the northern hemisphere, and decreasing temperatures in high southern latitudes occurred as the Drake Passage opened to deep-water. Low d18O values reported from deep-sea locations other than the Southern Ocean are shown to bias estimates of Antarctic ice volume, calling for a re-evaluation of the notion that Antarctic ice volume was significantly reduced during the late Oligocene.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            By far the most prescient insights into the interior structure of the planet have been provided on the basis of elastic wave seismology. Analysis of the travel times of shear or compression wave phases excited by individual earthquakes, or through analysis of the elastic gravitational free oscillations that individual earthquakes of sufficiently large magnitude may excite, has been the central focus of Earth physics research for more than a century. Unfortunately, data provide no information that is directly relevant to understanding the solid state `flow' of the polycrystalline outer `mantle' shell of the planet that is involved in the thermally driven convective circulation that is responsible for powering the `drift' of the continents and which controls the rate of planetary cooling on long timescales. For this reason, there has been an increasing focus on the understanding of physical phenomenology that is unambiguously associated with mantle flow processes that are distinct from those directly associated with the convective circulation itself. This paper reviews the past many decades of work that has been invested in understanding the most important of such processes, namely that which has come to be referred to as `glacial isostatic adjustment' (GIA). This process concerns the response of the planet to the loading and unloading of the high latitude continents by the massive accumulations of glacial ice that have occurred with almost metronomic regularity over the most recent million years of Earth history. Forced by the impact of gravitational               n               -body effects on the geometry of Earth's orbit around the Sun through the impact upon the terrestrial regime of received solar insolation, these surface mass loads on the continents have left indelible records of their occurrence in the `Earth system' consisting of the oceans, continents, and the great polar ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica themselves. Although this ice-age phenomenology has been clearly recognized since early in the last century, it was for over 50 years considered to be no more than an interesting curiosity, the understanding of which remained on the periphery of the theoretical physics of the Earth. This was the case in part because no globally applicable theory was available that could be applied to rigorously interpret the observations. Equally important to understanding the scientific lethargy that held back the understanding of this phenomenon involving mantle flow processes was the lack of appreciation of the wide range of observations that were in fact related to GIA physics. This paper is devoted to a review of the global theories of the GIA process that have since been developed as a means of interpreting the extensive variety of observations that are now recognized as being involved in the response of the planet to the loading and unloading of its surface by glacial ice. The paper will also provide examples of the further analyses of Earth physics and climate related processes that applications of the modern theoretical structures have enabled.},

  abstract = {Oscillations in ice sheet extent during early and middle Miocene are intermittently preserved in the sedimentary record from the Antarctic continental shelf, with widespread erosion occurring during major ice sheet advances, and open marine deposition during times of ice sheet retreat. Data from seismic reflection surveys and drill sites from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 28 and International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374, located across the present-day middle continental shelf of the central Ross Sea (Antarctica), indicate the presence of expanded early to middle Miocene sedimentary sections. These include the Miocene climate optimum (MCO ca. 17-14.6 Ma) and the middle Miocene climate transition (MMCT ca. 14.6-13.9 Ma). Here, we correlate drill core records, wireline logs and reflection seismic data to elucidate the depositional architecture of the continental shelf and reconstruct the evolution and variability of dynamic ice sheets in the Ross Sea during the Miocene. Drill-site data are used to constrain seismic isopach maps that document the evolution of different ice sheets and ice caps which influenced sedimentary processes in the Ross Sea through the early to middle Miocene. In the early Miocene, periods of localized advance of the ice margin are revealed by the formation of thick sediment wedges prograding into the basins. At this time, morainal bank complexes are distinguished along the basin margins suggesting sediment supply derived from marine-terminating glaciers. During the MCO, biosiliceous-bearing sediments are regionally mapped within the depocenters of the major sedimentary basin across the Ross Sea, indicative of widespread open marine deposition with reduced glacimarine influence. At the MMCT, a distinct erosive surface is interpreted as representing large-scale marine-based ice sheet advance over most of the Ross Sea paleo-continental shelf. The regional mapping of the seismic stratigraphic architecture and its correlation to drilling data indicate a regional transition through the Miocene from growth of ice caps and inland ice sheets with marine-terminating margins, to widespread marine-based ice sheets extending across the outer continental shelf in the Ross Sea.},

  abstract = {Geothermal heat flow (GHF) is an elusive physical property, yet it can reveal past and present plate tectonic processes. In Antarctica, GHF has further consequences in predicting the response of ice sheets to climate change. In this Review, we discuss variations in Antarctic GHF models based on geophysical methods and draw insights into tectonics and GHF model usage for ice sheet modelling. The inferred GHF at continental scale for West Antarctica (up to 119\,mW\,m-2, 95th percentile) points to numerous contributing influences, including non-s teady state neotectonic processes. Combined influences cause especially high values in the vicinity of the Thwaites Glacier, a location critical for the accurate prediction of accelerated loss of Antarctic ice mass. The inferred variations across East Antarctica are more subtle (up to 66\,mW\,m-2, 95th percentile), where slightly elevated values in some locations correspond to the influence of thinned lithosphere and tectonic units with concentrations of heat-p roducing elements. Fine-s cale anomalies owing to heat-producing elements and horizontal components of heat flow are important for regional modelling. GHF maps comprising central values with these fine-s cale anomalies captured within uncertainty bounds can thus enable improved ensemble-b ased ice sheet model predictions of Antarctic ice loss.},

  abstract = {The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, the ocean cavity beneath it, and the Weddell Sea that bounds it, form an important part of the global climate system by modulating ice discharge from the Antarctic Ice Sheet and producing cold dense water masses that feed the global thermohaline circulation. A prerequisite for modeling the ice sheet and oceanographic processes within the cavity is an accurate knowledge of the sub-ice sheet bedrock elevation, but beneath the ice shelf where airborne radar cannot penetrate, bathymetric data are sparse. This paper presents new seismic point measurements of cavity geometry from a particularly poorly sampled region south of Berkner Island that connects the Filchner and Ronne ice shelves. An updated bathymetric grid formed by combining the new data with existing data sets reveals several new features. In particular, a sill running between Berkner Island and the mainland could alter ocean circulation within the cavity and change our understanding of paleo-ice stream flow in the region. Also revealed are deep troughs near the grounding lines of Foundation and Support Force ice streams, which provide access for seawater with melting potential. Running an ocean tidal model with the new bathymetry reveals large differences in tidal current velocities, both within the new gridded region and further afield, potentially affecting sub-ice shelf melt rates.},

Initially, we obtain a linear approximation stabilized by the total variation functional that correctly maps the horizontal positions of the existing high-angle faults but produced poor estimates of the basin depths. Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.},

  abstract = {The Terror Rift is a 350 km-long, 50\textendash 70 km-wide, north-trending deep basin in the western Ross Sea, adjacent to the Transantarctic Mountains. The Terror Rift lies within the broader Victoria Land Basin, which experienced 100 km of a mid-Cenozoic extension. New fault and post-29 Ma seismic stratigraphic interpretations were developed using all the seismic reflection data available from the Antarctic Seismic Data Library System and were correlated to all the scientific coreholes. A new 3D velocity model was used for depth conversions. Depth-converted seismic profiles are used to image the faulting along the rift margins. Two segments of steep normal-separation faults, which are connected by a broad anticline, border the eastern margin, whereas steep to sub vertical faults, combined with a stratal dip, produce the relief present at the western margin. The overall geometry of the Terror Rift shows an asymmetric half-graben structure with a main bounding fault that dips alternatively eastward and westward in the southern and in the central parts, until it becomes a symmetric graben in the north. Both the eastern and western faults were active since at least 29 Ma in the southern and central Terror Rift and at least since 21 Ma in the north. This fault activity appears to have continued within the whole Terror Rift into post-Miocene time, as suggested by the significant component of post-Miocene vertical slip. The measurements of large sedimentary rock thicknesses changes over time between the rift shoulders and the deepest part of the basin and agree with the continuous faulting and relative subsidence in the southern Terror Rift that occurred between 29 and 13 Ma. These changes differ from several published papers that proposed that no significant tectonic activity occurred between 23 and 13 Ma. Despite the growth of the Terror Rift basin, the extension after 21 Ma was only {$\sim$}2\textendash 4 km across offshore mapped faults in the Terror Rift, and this minor extension agrees with a published plate tectonic study that suggests that the Terror Rift was a transtensional dextral transform boundary between 26 and 11 Ma. Therefore, the Terror Rift may have changed from an orthogonal rift into a transtensional transform boundary after 26 Ma, with the faulting after 11 Ma considered to be intraplate deformation.},

The products are derived from MODIS band 1 (red light: {$\sim$} 647 nm) and band 2 (infrared: {$\sim$} 857 nm) orbit swath data acquired during the 2003\textendash 2004 austral summer. Multiple images of all areas are combined in a data cumulation scheme to improve spatial resolution and increase radiometric content of the mosaics. The component images were de-striped, geo-registered, and re-sampled to the projection grid using the MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) software. A 125 m groundequivalent polar stereographic projection was used, identical to previous radar image mosaics and similar to several other continent-wide data sets. Geo-location accuracy of the final mosaics is better than 125 m. Swath acquisition times were limited to the range 05:00\textendash 13:30 UT to provide broad but uniform mosaic illumination. Regions of cloud cover, blowing snow, and intense forward scattering were masked prior to compositing. The MOA snow grain size data set image provides the first continent-wide semi-quantitative map of mean summer snow, firn, and blue ice grain size. Optical grain size (radius) was determined using a normalized difference index derived from MODIS band 1 and band 2 rad values. Atmospheric correction, adjustments for directional reflectance variation and snow grain size estimation were accomplished by a look-up table, generated by a combination of published models of snow spectral reflectance and atmosphere radiative transfer. Validation of the snow grain size image is provided by in situ spectra of snow-covered sea ice made in October, 2003. We use the new data sets to determine major ice shelf areas, and shelf edge, coastline, and ice grounding line vector files, and determine areas of selected blue ice regions.

  abstract = {Abstract. Estimating the future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is critical for improving future sea level rise (SLR) projections. Numerical ice sheet models are invaluable tools for bounding Antarctic vulnerability; yet, few continental-scale projections of century-scale AIS SLR contribution exist, and those that do vary by up to an order of magnitude. This is partly because model projections of future sea level are inherently uncertain and depend largely on the model's boundary conditions and climate forcing, which themselves are unknown due to the uncertainty in the projections of future anthropogenic emissions and subsequent climate response. Here, we aim to improve the understanding of how uncertainties in model forcing and boundary conditions affect ice sheet model simulations. With use of sampling techniques embedded within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) framework, we assess how uncertainties in snow accumulation, ocean-induced melting, ice viscosity, basal friction, bedrock elevation, and the presence of ice shelves impact continental-scale 100-year model simulations of AIS future sea level contribution. Overall, we find that AIS sea level contribution is strongly affected by grounding line retreat, which is driven by the magnitude of ice shelf basal melt rates and by variations in bedrock topography. In addition, we find that over 1.2\,m of AIS global mean sea level contribution over the next century is achievable, but not likely, as it is tenable only in response to unrealistically large melt rates and continental ice shelf collapse. Regionally, we find that under our most extreme 100-year warming experiment generalized for the entire ice sheet, the Amundsen Sea sector is the most significant source of model uncertainty (1032\,mm 6{$\sigma$} spread) and the region with the largest potential for future sea level contribution (297\,mm). In contrast, under a more plausible forcing informed regionally by literature and model sensitivity studies, the Ronne basin has a greater potential for local increases in ice shelf basal melt rates. As a result, under this more likely realization, where warm waters reach the continental shelf under the Ronne ice shelf, it is the Ronne basin, particularly the Evans and Rutford ice streams, that are the greatest contributors to potential SLR (161\,mm) and to simulation uncertainty (420\,mm 6{$\sigma$} spread).},

There exist a variety of methods aimed at uncertainty estimation, which are often complicated and difficult to implement. We present an inversion technique that produces multiple solutions, based on bootstrap resampling, to create a qualitative uncertainty measure for 2-D magnetotelluric inversion models. The approach is easy to implement, can be used with almost any inversion code, and does not require access to the inversion software's source code. It is capable of detecting the effect of data uncertainties on the model result rather than just analysing the effect of model variations on the model response. To obtain uncertainty estimates for an inversion model, the original data set is resampled repeatedly and alternate data set realizations are created and inverted. This ensemble of solutions is then statistically analysed to determine the variability between the different solutions. The process yields interpretable uncertainty maps for the inversion model and we demonstrate its effectiveness to qualitatively quantify uncertainty in synthetic model tests and a case study.},

In Antarctica, most digital radar-sounding data have been collected in the last 2 decades, limiting our ability to understand processes that govern longer-term ice-sheet behavior. Here, we demonstrate how analog radar data collected over 40 y ago in Antarctica can be combined with modern records to quantify multidecadal changes. Specifically, we digitize over 400,000 line kilometers of exploratory Antarctic radar data originally recorded on 35-mm optical film between 1971 and 1979. We leverage the increased geometric and radiometric resolution of our digitization process to show how these data can be used to identify and investigate hydrologic, geologic, and topographic features beneath and within the ice sheet. To highlight their scientific potential, we compare the digitized data with contemporary radar measurements to reveal that the remnant eastern ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica had thinned between 10 and 33\% between 1978 and 2009. We also release the collection of scanned radargrams in their entirety in a persistent public archive along with updated geolocation data for a subset of the data that reduces the mean positioning error from 5 to 2.5 km. Together, these data represent a unique and renewed extensive, multidecadal historical baseline, critical for observing and modeling ice-sheet change on societally relevant timescales.},

  abstract = {The possibility that a deep mantle plume manifests Pliocene and Quaternary volcanism and potential elevated heat flux in West Antarctica has been studied for more than 30 years. Recent seismic images support the plume hypothesis as the cause of Marie Byrd Land (MBL) volcanism and geophysical structure. Mantle plumes may more than double the geothermal heat flux above nominal continental values. A dearth of in situ ice sheet basal data exists that samples the heat flux. Consequently, we examine a realistic distribution of heat flux associated with a possible late Cenozoic mantle plume in West Antarctica and explore its impact on thermal and melt conditions at the ice sheet base. We use a simple analytical mantle plume parameterization to produce geothermal heat flux at the base of the ice sheet. The three-dimensional ice flow model includes an enthalpy framework and full-Stokes stress balance. As both the putative plume location and extent are uncertain, we perform broadly scoped experiments to characterize the impact of the plume on geothermal heat flux and ice sheet basal conditions. The experiments show that mantle plumes have an important local impact on the ice sheet, with basal melting rates reaching several centimeters per year directly above the hotspot. In order to be consistent with observations of basal hydrology in MBL, the upper bound on the plume-derived geothermal heat flux is 150 mW/m2. In contrast, the active lake system of the lower part of Whillans Ice Stream suggests a widespread anomalous mantle heat flux, linked to a rift source.},

Ambient noise tomography exploiting data from more than 200 seismic stations deployed over the past 18 years is used to construct Rayleigh wave phase and group velocity dispersion maps. Comparison between the ambient noise phase velocity maps with those constructed using teleseismic earthquakes confirms the accuracy of both results. These maps, together with P receiver function waveforms, are used to construct a new 3-D shear velocity (Vs) model for the crust and uppermost mantle using a Bayesian Monte Carlo algorithm. The new 3-D seismic model shows the dichotomy of the tectonically active West Antarctica (WANT) and the stable and ancient East Antarctica (EANT). In WANT, the model exhibits a slow uppermost mantle along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) front, interpreted as the thermal effect from Cenozoic rifting. Beneath the southern TAMs, the slow uppermost mantle extends horizontally beneath the traditionally recognized EANT, hypothesized to be associated with lithospheric delamination. Thin crust and lithosphere observed along the Amundsen Sea coast and extending into the interior suggest involvement of these areas in Cenozoic rifting. EANT, with its relatively thick and cold crust and lithosphere marked by high Vs, displays a slower Vs anomaly beneath the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains in the uppermost mantle, which we hypothesize may be the signature of a compositionally anomalous body, perhaps remnant from a continental collision.},

New features in this map include high GHF in the southern Transantarctic Mountains where warmer uppermost mantle is introduced by lithospheric removal and in the Thwaites Glacier region. Additionally, a modest GHF in the central West Antarctic Rift system near the Siple Coast and an absence of large-scale regions with GHF greater than 90 mW/m2 are found.},

Here we present newly constructed seismic images of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath central Antarctica derived from recently acquired seismic data, indicating ongoing lithospheric foundering beneath the southern TAMs. These images reveal an absence of thick, cold cratonic lithosphere beneath the southern TAMs. Instead, an uppermost-mantle slow seismic anomaly extends across the mountain front and 350 km into East Antarctica, beneath a high plateau near the South Pole. Under the slow anomaly, a relatively high-wavespeed root is found at \textasciitilde 200 km depth, connected with the East Antarctic lithosphere, suggesting that sinking lithosphere has been replaced at shallow depths by warm, slow-velocity asthenosphere.

New structural, petrological, and geochronological data from Marie Byrd Land reveal aspects of the kinematics, thermal history, and chronology of the Cretaceous intracontinental extension phase that cannot be readily explained by a single progressive event. Elevated temperatures in ``Lachlan-type'' crust caused extensive crustal melting and mid-crustal flow within a dextral transcurrent strain environment, leading to rapid extension and locally to exhumation and rapid cooling of a migmatite dome and detachment footwall structures. Peak metamorphism and onset of crustal flow that brought about WARS extension between 105 Ma and 90 Ma is kinematically, temporally, and spatially linked to the active convergent margin system of East Gondwana. West Antarctica-New Zealand breakup is distinguished as a separate event at 83-70 Ma, from the standpoint of kinematics and thermal evolution.},

Water fed to icestream beds thus influences ice-sheet dynamics and, potentially, sea-level rise. It is recognized that both till and the sedimentary basins from which it originates are porous and could host a reservoir of mobile groundwater that interacts with the subglacial interfacial system. According to recent numerical modelling, up to half of all water available for basal lubrication, and time lags between hydrological forcing and ice-sheet response as long as millennia, may have been overlooked in models of ice flow. Here, we review evidence in support of Antarctic groundwater and propose how it can be measured to ascertain the extent to which it modulates ice flow. We present new seismoelectric soundings of subglacial till, and magnetotelluric and transient electromagnetic forward models of subglacial groundwater reservoirs. We demonstrate that multifaceted and integrated geophysical datasets can detect, delineate and quantify the groundwater contents of subglacial sedimentary basins and, potentially, monitor groundwater exchange rates between subglacial till layers.

Here we present an analysis of bed roughness in the Siple Coast region of West Antarctica from airborne radio-echo sounding data. The ice streams are associated generally with low bed roughness values, which decrease downstream. The bed of the slow-flowing Ice Stream C (\textasciitilde 10 000 km2) is also characterized by being smooth at all scales (wavelengths ranging from 5 km to in excess of 40 km). Furthermore, the bed is smooth either side of Ice Stream C. This suggests the location of the ice stream is controlled by internal ice sheet dynamics rather than by bed morphology. If the ice stream were encouraged to migrate laterally, when active, there would be little resistance offered by the subglacial morphology. Other inter-ice stream regions are rough, however, indicating a subglacial topographic influence on ice stream position. Bed roughness increases up-flow of ice streams, which, unless the bed is modified, may limit the inland migration of these systems. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The method interpolates the data to be gridded with a surfacehaving continuous secondderivatives and minimal total squaredcurvature. The minimum-curvature surface has an analogy in elastic plate flexure and approximatesthe shape adoptedby a thin plate flexed to pass through the data points. Minimum-curvature surfaces may have large oscillations and extraneous inflection points which make them unsuitable for gridding in many of the applications where they are commonly used. These extraneous inflection points can be eliminated by addingtension to the elastic-plate flexure equation. It is straightforward to generalize minimum-curvature gridding algorithms to include a tension parameter; the same systemof equations must be solved in either case and only the relative weights of the coefficients change. Therefore, solutions under tension require no more computational effort than minimum-curvature solutions, and any algorithm which can solve the minimum-curvature equationscan solve the more general system. We give common geologicexamples where minimum-curvature gridding produces erroneous results but gridding with tension yields a good solution. We also outline how to improve the convergence of an iterative method of solution for the gridding equations.},

Losses outpaced gains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 Gt a               -1               ) and Antarctica (118 Gt a               -1               ) contributing 14 mm to sea level.

Nevertheless, its major drawback is the large computational cost in terms of processing time and computer memory. We present two techniques for reducing the computational cost of equivalent source processing: block-averaging source locations and the gradient-boosted equivalent source algorithm. Through block-averaging, we reduce the number of source coefficients that must be estimated while retaining the minimum desired resolution in the final processed data. With the gradient-boosting method, we estimate the sources coefficients in small batches along overlapping windows, allowing us to reduce the computer memory requirements arbitrarily to conform to the constraints of the available hardware. We show that the combination of block-averaging and gradient-boosted equivalent sources is capable of producing accurate interpolations through tests against synthetic data. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by gridding a gravity data set covering Australia with over 1.7 million observations using a modest personal computer.},

The focus of this study is on the mechanisms responsible for the circulation of warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) within troughs running perpendicular to the continental shelf. This is examined using process-oriented numerical experiments with an eddy-resolving (1 km) 3D ocean model that includes a static and thermodynamically active ice shelf. Three mechanisms that create a significant onshore flow within the trough are identified: 1) a deep onshore flow driven by the melt of the ice shelf, 2) interaction between the longshore mean flow and the trough, and 3) interaction between a Rossby wave along the shelf break and the trough. In each case the onshore flow is sufficient to maintain the warm temperatures underneath the ice shelf and basal melt rates of O(1 m yr-1). The third mechanism in particular reproduces several features revealed by moorings from Marguerite Trough (Bellingshausen Sea): the temperature maximum at middepth, a stronger intrusion on the downstream edge of the trough, and the appearance of warm anticyclonic anomalies every week. Sensitivity experiments highlight the need to properly resolve the small baroclinic radii of these regions (5 km on the shelf)\textemdash simulations at 3-km resolution cannot reproduce mechanism 3 and the associated heat transport.},

This type of faulting is mainly recognized in intraplate regions but is also proposed for some plate boundary areas. Stresses induced by the advance and retreat of an ice sheet are thought to be released during or after ice melting and to reactivate pre-existing faults. Past reactivations were probably accompanied by great-magnitude seismic events triggering hundreds of landslides and seismically induced soft-sediment deformation structures in the region surrounding the faults. Reliable field evidence for reactivated faults in and around many formerly glaciated areas has considerably increased the number of confirmed and probable glacially induced faults in recent years. We provide a historical overview of dedicated geoscientific investigations from the early reports of this type of faulting until recent findings. Beforehand, we discuss the definition of glacially triggered faulting, suggest a revision of the classification criteria and update the grading criteria for glacially induced fault claims.},

A significant proportion of ice mass loss from these ice shelves is through ocean-driven melting which is controlled by largely unobserved oceanic thermodynamic and circulatory processes in the cavity beneath the ice shelf. Here we use direct measurements to provide evidence of the changing water column structure in the cavity beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, the planet's largest ice shelf by area. The cavity water column data exhibit both basal and benthic boundary layers, along with evidence of tidally modulated and diffusively convecting internal mixing processes. A region of thermohaline interleaving in the upper\textendash middle water column indicates elevated diffusion and the potential to modify the cavity circulation. The measurements were recorded using the Aotearoa New Zealand Ross Ice Shelf Program hot water drill borehole melted in the central region of the shelf in December 2017 (HWD2), only the second borehole through the central region of the ice shelf, following J9 in 1977. These data, and comparison with the 1977 data, provide valuable insight into ice shelf cavity circulation and aid understanding of the evolution of the presently stable Ross Ice Shelf.},

Forward modeling of gravity data suggests slight crustal thickening of 5 km beneath the mountain front indicating partial isostatic compensation by thickened crust. New magnetic data help characterize the sub-ice geology inland of the Transantarctic Mountains with the observed magnetic anomaly field dominated by Granite Harbour Intrusives, similar to the magnetic field in Victoria Land. However, the typical pattern of anomalies caused by Jurassic tholeiitic magmatism elsewhere along the Transantarctic Mountains is not observed, nor is the mesa topography that is often associated with the Ferrar Dolerite. Together, these observations rule out the widespread presence of Ferrar Dolerite sills within the survey area. A pronounced magnetic lineament, herein named the South Pole Lineament, parallel to the 0\textdegree/180\textdegree{} longitudinal meridian, beneath the South Pole defines a previously unknown tectonic trend of the East Antarctic craton. The lineament suggests the presence of a lithosphericscale structure beneath South Pole, projecting into a fault mapped from ice-penetrating radar data and extending to Shackleton Glacier, the site of a major geological boundary across the Transantarctic Mountains. Potentially, the lineament is the expression of the edge of the undeformed craton, an inherited structure created during assembly or breakup of Rodinia and Gondwana supercontinents; or an intracontinental transform.},

A new comprehensive aerogeophysical data set, extending 1150 km from the Ross Sea into the interior of East Antarctica provides insights into the complex structure inland of the Transantarctic Mountains. Geophysical maps, compiled from 21 000 km of gravity, magnetic and subglacial topography data, outline the boundaries of several geologic and tectonic segments within the survey area. The coherent pattern in magnetic data and mesa topography suggests a subglacial extent of the Transantarctic Mountains 400\^500 km inland the last exposed rock outcrops. We estimate the maximum thickness of a potential sediment infill in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin to be less than 1 km, based on gravity modeling and source depth estimates from magnetic data. The coherent nature of the potential field and topography data, together with the northwest\^southeast trends, define the Adventure Subglacial Trench and the Resolution Subglacial Highlands as a tectonic unit. The crustal structure and the strong similarity of the observed gravity with fold-and-thrust belts suggest a compressional scenario for the origin of the Adventure Subglacial Trench and the Resolution Subglacial Highlands. The complexity and apparent structural control of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin raise the issue of what influence preexisting structures may have played in the formation of the Transantarctic Mountains system. The previous hypothesis of a thermal boundary beneath the mountains is difficult to reconcile with our new gravity data. The apparent difficulties to match our new data with certain key aspects of previous models suggests that a reassessment of the existing uplift models is necessary. We have modeled the prominent gravity anomaly over the Transantarctic Mountains with thicker crust.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Ice shelves form where ice flows off the Antarctic ice sheet onto the sea to produce rather flat slabs of floating ice which, for the theoretician, are the simplest of all large ice masses. Boundary conditions are well defined, conditions change very slowly over distances that are large compared with ice thickness, and horizontal velocities are independent of depth. Unconfined ice shelves can be used as giant creep machines to investigate the ice flow law at low stresses. Further inland, where movement is hampered by obstructions such as grounded ice rises and by shear between the ice shelf and its sides, the ice shelf transmits a backpressure which tends to restrict drainage from the ice sheets that feed it. Wastage from ice shelves is principally by calving and by bottom melting. There has been no direct measurement of bottom-melting rates, but indirect evidence suggests that, near the seaward edges of ice shelves, bottom-melting rates may exceed one metre per year, with significant melting within about 100 km of the ice front. Further inland there may be bottom freezing, and analysis of cores taken from the Amery Ice Shelf indicate that bottom-freezing rates average 0.5 m a               \textendash 1               over a distance of 200 km. Such high freezing-rates are probably exceptional, and, beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, freezing appears to be insignificant even at a distance of 400 km from the ice front.                          Because of their accessibility ice shelves have been studied in considerable detail, but many problems remain. In particular we need to improve our understanding of basal flux, ice-shelf dynamics near the grounding line, the calving of icebergs, and the state of equilibrium of ice rises. In addition there is a clear need for basic data from the Filchner-Ronne ice shelf.           ,              R\'esum\'e             Les plateformes se forment lorsque de la glace s'\'ecoule de la calotte glaciaire de l' Antarctique vers la mer pour produire des plaques assez plates de glace flottante qui pour les th\'eoriciens sont les plus simples de toutes les grandes masses de glace. Les conditions aux limites sont bien d\'efinies, ces conditions varient tr\`es lentement sur des distances qui sont grandes en comparaison de l'\'epaisseur de la glace et les vitesses horizontales sont ind\'ependantes de la profondeur. Des plateformes non limnit\'ees peuvent \^etre utilis\'ees comme un gigantesque appareil de mesure pour \'etudier la loi d'\'ecoulement de la glace sous de faibles contraintes. Plus loin vers le continent, lorsque le mouvement est g\^en\'e par des obstacles comme des domes insulaires de glace ou par le cisaillement entre la plateforme et ses rives, celle-ci transmet une pression r\'esistante qui tend a restreindre l'\'ecoulement depuis la calotte glaciaire qui la nourrit. Les pertes de la plateforme sont principalement les v\^elages et la fusion au fond. Il n'y a pas eu de mesures directes de fusion au fond mais des preuves indirectes montrent que, pr\'es du c\^ot\'e tourn\'e vers la mer de la plateforme, la fusion au fond peut atteindre 1 m/an avec une fusion significative jusqu'\`a 100 km du front de glace. Plus loin vers le continent il peut y avoir regel au fond et des analyses de carottes pr\'eleves de l' Amery Ice Shelf indiquent que la vitesse de regel au fond est en moyenne de 0,5 m/an sur une distance de 200 km. Une telle importance du regel est probablement exceptionnelle et sous le Ross Ice Shelf, le regel appara\^it comme insignifiant m\^eme \`a une distance de 400 km du front de glace.             Gr\^ace \`a leur accessibilit\'e les plateformes ont \'et\'e \'etudi\'ees tr\'es en d\'etail mais bien des probl\'emes subsistent. En particulier nous devons am\'eliorer notre compr\'ehension du flux au fond de la dynamique de la plateforme pr\`es de la ligne de d\'ecollement, du v\^elage des icebergs et de l'\'etat d'\'equilibre des m\^oles de glace. En sus il y a un besoin \'evident de donn\'ees de base en provenance de la plateforme de Filchnerx\textendash{} Ronne.           ,              Zusammenfassung             Schelfeise entstehen dort, wo Eis aus dem antarktischen Eisschild ins Meer fliesst und dabei weitgehend flache Tafeln schwimmenden Eises bildet, die \textemdash{} theoretische gesehen \textemdash{} die einlachste Form grosser Eismassen darstellen. Die Randbedingungen sind klar definiert, die Verh\"altnisse \"andern sich nur allm\"ahlich \"uber Entfernungen, die im Vergleich zur Eisdecke gross sind, und die Horizontalgeschwindigkeiten sind unabh\"angig von der Tiefe. Unbegrenzte Schelfeise k\"onnen als gewaltige Kriechapparate zur Untersuchung des Eis-Fliessgesetzes bei geringen Spannungen benutzt werden. Weiter landeinw\"arts, wo die Bewegung durch Hindernisse wie aufsitzende Eiserhebungen und durch Scherkr\"afte zwischen dem Schelfeis und seiner Umrahmung gehemmt ist, \"ubertr\"agt das Schelfeis enen R\"uckdruck, der den Ausfluss aus dem ern\"ahrenden Eisschild einzuschr\"anken sucht. Der Abbau des Schelfeises erfolgt im wesentlichen durch Kalben und durch Abschmelzen an der Unterseite. Es gibt keine direkte Messung von Schmelzraten an der Unterseite, doch deuten indirekte Anzeichen darauf hin, dass nahe an der Front von Schelfeisen die Schmelzraten 1 m pro Jahr \"uberschreiten k\"onnen und dass innerhalb der ersten 100 km hinter der Eisfront betr\"achtliches Abschmelzen stattfindet. Weiter landeinw\"arts kann Anfrieren an der Unterseite eintreten; Analysen von Kernen aus dem Amery Ice Shelf deuten darauf hin, dass die Anfrierraten an der Unterseite im Mittel 0.5 m pro Jahr auf eine Distanz von 200 km betragen. Solch hohe Anfrierraten bilden vermutlich die Ausnahme; unter dem Ross Ice Shelf d\"urfte das Anfrieren selbst in Entfernungen bis 400 km von der Eisfront nur unwesentlich sein.             Wegen ihrer zug\"unglichkeit wurden Schelfeise sehr eingehend untersucht, doch bleiben noch viele Probleme. Im einzelnen ist ein besseres Verst\"andnis der Fliessvorg\"ange in der Tiefe, der Schelfeis-Dynamik nahe der Aufsetzlinie, des Kalbens von Eisbergen und des Gleichgewichtszustandes von Eiserhebungen erforderlich. Ausserdem liegt ein dringendes Bed\"urfnis nach grundlegenden Daten \"uber das Filchner\textendash Ronne-Schelfeis vor.},

Existing global or pan-Antarctic topography data sets have turned out to contain various inconsistencies and inaccuracies. The goal of this work is to compile independent regional surveys and maps into a global data set. We use the S-2004 global 1-min bathymetry as the backbone and add an improved version of the BEDMAP topography (ALBMAP bedrock topography) for an area that roughly coincides with the Antarctic continental shelf. The position of the merging line is individually chosen in different sectors in order to capture the best of both data sets. High-resolution gridded data for ice shelf topography and cavity geometry of the Amery, Fimbul, FilchnerRonne, Larsen C and George VI Ice Shelves, and for Pine Island Glacier are carefully merged into the ambient ice and ocean topographies. Multibeam survey data for bathymetry in the former Larsen B cavity and the southeastern Bellingshausen Sea have been obtained from the data centers of Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), gridded, and blended into the existing bathymetry map. The resulting global 1-min Refined Topography data set (RTopo-1) contains selfconsistent maps for upper and lower ice surface heights, bedrock topography, and surface type (open ocean, grounded ice, floating ice, bare land surface). The data set is available in NetCDF format from the PANGAEA database at doi:10.1594/pangaea.741917.},

  abstract = {Petermann Glacier is a major glacier in northern Greenland, maintaining one of the few remaining floating ice tongues in Greenland. Monitoring programs, such as NASA's Operation IceBridge have surveyed Petermann Glacier over several decades and have found it to be stable in terms of mass balance, velocity and grounding-line position. The future vulnerability of this large glacier to changing ocean temperatures and climate depends on the ocean\textendash ice interactions beneath its floating tongue. These cannot currently be predicted due to a lack of knowledge of the bathymetry underneath the ice tongue. Here we use aerogravity data from Operation IceBridge, together with airborne radar and laser data and shipborne bathymetry-soundings to model the bathymetry beneath the Petermann ice tongue. We find a basement-cored inner sill at 540\textendash 610 m depth that results in a water cavity with minimum thickness of 400 m about 25 km from the grounding line. The sill is coincident with the location of the melt rate minimum. Seaward of the sill the fjord is strongly asymmetric. The deepest point occurs on the eastern side of the fjord at 1150 m, 600 m deeper than on the western side. This asymmetry is due to a sedimentary deposit on the western side of the fjord. A 350\textendash 410 m-deep outer sill, also mapped by marine surveys, marks the seaward end of the fjord. This outer sill is aligned with the proposed Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) grounding-line position for Petermann Glacier. The inner sill likely provided a stable pinning point for the grounding line in the past, punctuating the retreat of Petermann Glacier since the LGM.},

  abstract = {Estimating the relief of the Moho from gravity data is a computationally intensive nonlinear inverse problem. What is more, the modelling must take the Earths curvature into account when the study area is of regional scale or greater. We present a regularized nonlinear gravity inversion method that has a low computational footprint and employs a spherical Earth approximation. To achieve this, we combine the highly efficient Bott's method with smoothness regularization and a discretization of the anomalous Moho into tesseroids (spherical prisms). The computational efficiency of our method is attained by harnessing the fact that all matrices involved are sparse. The inversion results are controlled by three hyperparameters: the regularization parameter, the anomalous Moho density-contrast, and the reference Moho depth. We estimate the regularization parameter using the method of hold-out cross-validation. Additionally, we estimate the density-contrast and the reference depth using knowledge of the Moho depth at certain points. We apply the proposed method to estimate the Moho depth for the South American continent using satellite gravity data and seismological data. The final Moho model is in accordance with previous gravity-derived models and seismological data. The misfit to the gravity and seismological data is worse in the Andes and best in oceanic areas, central Brazil and Patagonia, and along the Atlantic coast. Similarly to previous results, the model suggests a thinner crust of 30\textendash 35 km under the Andean foreland basins. Discrepancies with the seismological data are greatest in the Guyana Shield, the central Solimo\texttildelow es and Amazonas Basins, the Parana\textasciiacute{} Basin, and the Borborema province. These differences suggest the existence of crustal or mantle density anomalies that were unaccounted for during gravity data processing.},

  abstract = {Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub repository directly and package them with the source and binary distributions (e.g., scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and scikit-image (Van der Walt et al., 2014) do this). As data files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the files from a remote server to the user's computer. The same problem is faced by scientists using version control to manage their research projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files, keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), Cartopy (Met Office, n.d.), and PyVista (Sullivan \& Kaszynski, 2019) all include code dedicated to this particular task. Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching and maintaining data files.},

The global bathymetric correction is discussed. Two issues associated with compilation and inversion of bathymetrically and topographically corrected gravity disturbances in regions of negative ellipsoidal (geodetic) heights are pointed out: the evaluation of normal gravity and the harmonic continuation of the gravity data. Stripping, the removal of an effect of a known density contrast, is considered also for additional geological elements such as lakes, glaciers, sedimentary basins, isostatic mountain roots, etc. The stripping corrections are discussed in the context of the gravimetric inverse problem.},

The first is associated with the evaluation of normal gravity below the surface of the reference ellipsoid (RE). The latter is tied to the legitimacy of the harmonic continuation of the BT disturbance in these regions. These two issues are proposed to be resolved by the so called reference quasi-ellipsoid (RQE) approach. New bathymetric and topographic corrections are derived based on the RQE and the inverse problem is formulated based on the RQE. The RQE approach enables the computation of normal gravity by means of the international gravity formula, and makes the harmonic continuation in the regions of negative heights of gravity stations legitimate. The gravimetric inversion is then transformed from the RQE approach back to the RE approach, following the now legitimate harmonic upward continuation of the gravity data to stations on or above the RE. Stripping, the removal of an effect of a known density contrast, is considered in the context of the RQE approach. A numerical case study is presented for the RQE approach in a region of NW Canada.},

  abstract = {The rigorous relation between the sought subsurface anomalous density distribution and the gravity anomaly, the gravity disturbance, and the geoidal height is newly reviewed. The emphasis is put on the proper treatment of the respective effects of topographical masses. The aim is to prove, that the rigorous formulation of the above mentioned relations calls for using such topographical corrections that adopt the reference ellipsoid as the lower boundary of the topography, and a reference topographical density. We base our derivations on a reference topographical density that is chosen to be globally constant. Such topographical corrections are then referred to as ``No Ellipsoidal Topography of Constant Density'' corrections, abbreviated as ``NETC'' corrections, as they differ from the commonly used Bouguer topographical corrections. We derive the NETC corrections to the disturbing potential, the gravity disturbance, the gravity anomaly, and the geoidal height. Equations are derived, that link the anomalous density, via Newton integrals with specific kernels, with the NETC gravity disturbance, the NETC gravity anomaly, and the NETC geoidal height. Prescriptions for compiling the NETC gravity disturbance, anomaly, and geoidal height from observable data are derived. It is proved, that the NETC gravity disturbance is rigorously equal to the gravitational effect (attraction) of the anomalous density distribution inside the entire earth. That is the fundamental point of the paper. The spherical complete Bouguer anomaly (SCBA) widely used in geophysical studies is then compared with the NETC gravity disturbance. The SCBA is also demonstrated to be a hybrid quantity, neither an anomaly, nor a disturbance. The systematic deviation between the SCBA and the NETC gravity disturbance is shown to be the most general form of the so called geophysical indirect effect (GIE), which is defined as the departure of the SCBA from the attraction of anomalous earth's masses. The GIE is computed for the area of the Eastern Alps.},

Each type produces a specific ``topo\textendash corrected gravity disturbance'', referred to as ``NT'', ``NTC'', ``NET'', and ``NETC''. Our objective is to compare the four types and to study the physical meaning, in the light of gravity data interpretation/inversion, of these four gravity disturbances. Our method of investigation is the decomposition of the actual potential and actual gravity. It is shown, that the ``NETC gravity disturbance'' \textendash{} i.e. the gravity disturbance corrected for the gravitational effect of topographical masses of constant density with the topo\textendash surface as the upper boundary and the reference ellipsoid as the lower boundary \textendash{} is rigorously and exactly equal to the gravitational effect of anomalous density inside the entire earth, i.e., below the topo\textendash surface. The regions, where the four types of the topo\textendash corrected gravity disturbance are harmonic, are studied also. Finally some attention is paid to areas over the globe, where geodetic (ellipsoidal) heights of the topo\textendash surface are negative, with regard to the evaluation of the topo\textendash correction and in the context of the gravimetric inverse problem. The strategy for the global evaluation of the ``NETC topo\textendash correction'', or its evaluation in areas with negative ellipsoidal topography, is presented.},

We deployed four autonomous phase-sensitive radars on its ice shelf to monitor ice-ocean interactions near its grounding zone and made active source seismic observations to constrain gravity-derived bathymetry models. We observe an asymmetry in basal melting with mean melt rates along the grounding zone differing by up to 20 m/a. Our new bathymetry model reveals that this melt rate asymmetry coincides with an asymmetry in water column thickness and that the low-melting ice-shelf portion is shielded from the main cavity circulation.

Our results highlight the key role of bathymetry near grounding lines for accurate modeling of ice-shelf melt, and the importance of sustained multi-year monitoring, especially at ice-shelf cavities where the dominant melt rate drivers vary primarily inter-annually.},

  abstract = {Understanding ice sheet evolution through the geologic past can help constrain ice sheet models that predict future ice dynamics. Existing geological records of grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, have been confined to ice-free and terrestrial archives, which reflect dynamics from periods of more extensive ice cover. Therefore, our perspective of grounding line retreat since the Last Glacial Maximum remains incomplete. Sediments beneath Ross Ice Shelf and grounded ice offer complementary insight into the southernmost extent of grounding line retreat, yielding a more complete view of ice dynamics during deglaciation. Here we thermochemically separate the youngest organic carbon to estimate ages from sediments extracted near the Whillans Ice Stream grounding line to provide direct evidence for grounding line retreat in that region as recent as the mid-Holocene (7.2 kyr B.P.). Our study demonstrates the utility of accurately dated, grounding-line-proximal sediment deposits for reconstructing past interactions between marine and subglacial environments. Plain Language Summary Ice sheet grounding lines, where ice loses contact with the underlying bed and transitions to an ice shelf floating on the ocean, are critical areas that govern the stability of marine-based ice sheets. However, the short period (years to decades) that we have been able to map grounding lines from ground, airborne, and satellite observations compared to the long periods over which ice sheets change (centuries to millenia) limits our knowledge of grounding line stability. We focus our geologic perspective of grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea, a region that has experienced a high degree of change throughout the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Prior work reconstructing the timeline of ice sheet change in this region is based heavily on ice-free marine sedimentary records, where dates of the first open marine sedimentation after ice retreat can be estimated. Dating sediments from beneath floating ice shelves and near grounding lines has proven difficult for both logistical and methodological reasons, limiting our understanding of grounding line evolution. We used novel radiocarbon dating methods on sediments collected from beneath the floating Ross Ice Shelf to find that the grounding line retreated inland of the current position during the mid-Holocene and subsequently readvanced.},

The influx of fresh water is known to substantially influence ocean circulation and biological productivity, but relatively little is known about the factors controlling basal melt rate or how basal melt is spatially distributed beneath the ice shelf. Also unknown is the relative importance of subglacial discharge from the grounded ice sheet in contributing to the export of fresh water from the ice shelf cavity. Here we compare the observed spatial distribution of basal melt rate to a new sub-iceshelf bathymetry map inferred from airborne gravity surveys and to locations of subglacial discharge from the grounded ice sheet. We find that melt rates are high where bathymetric troughs provide a pathway for warm Circumpolar Deep Water to enter the ice shelf cavity and that melting is enhanced where subglacial discharge fresh water flows across the grounding line. This is the first study to address the relative importance of meltwater production of the Getz Ice Shelf from both ocean and subglacial sources.},

As a cross-platform tool producing high-quality maps and figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new ``modern mode'' to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls ``classic mode.'' GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.

Faster upper mantle P-wave velocities ({$\sim$} +1\%) characterize the eastern part of the RSE, indicating that the lithosphere in this part of the RSE may not have been reheated by mid-to-late Cenozoic rifting that affected other parts of the Late Cretaceous West Antarctic Rift System. Slower upper mantle velocities ({$\sim$} -1\%) characterize the western part of the RSE over a {$\sim$}500 km-wide region, extending from the central RSE to the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM). Within this region, the model shows two areas of even slower velocities ({$\sim$} -1.5\%) centered beneath Mt. Erebus and Mt. Melbourne along the TAM front. We attribute the broader region of slow velocities mainly to reheating of the lithospheric mantle by Paleogene rifting, while the slower velocities beneath the areas of recent volcanism may reflect a Neogene-present phase of rifting and/or plume activity associated with the formation of the Terror Rift. Beneath the Ford Ranges and King Edward VII Peninsula in western Marie Byrd Land, the P-wave model shows lateral variability in upper mantle velocities of {$\pm$}0.5\% over distances of a few hundred km. The heterogeneity in upper mantle velocities imaged beneath the RSE and western Marie Byrd Land, assuming no significant variation in mantle composition, indicates variations in upper mantle temperatures of at least 100 {$\smwhtcircle$}C. These temperature variations could lead to differences in surface heat flow of {$\sim$} {$\pm$}10 mW/m2 and mantle viscosity of 102 Pa s regionally across the study area, possibly influencing the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet by affecting basal ice conditions and glacial isostatic adjustment.},

This provides a realistic key boundary condition for modeling the first big Antarctic ice sheets at this time instead of using the present day bedrock topography, which has changed significantly from millions of years of tectonism and erosion. We reconstruct topography using a set of tools including ice sheet-erosion models, models of thermal subsidence and plate movement. Erosion estimates are constrained with offshore sediment volumes estimated from seismic stratigraphy. Maximum and minimum topographic reconstructions are presented as indicators of the range of uncertainty. Our results point to a significant upland area in the Ross Sea/Marie Byrd Land and Weddell Sea sectors. In addition, East Antarctic coastal troughs are much shallower than today due to the restoration of material that has been selectively eroded by the evolving ice sheets. Parts of East Antarctica have not changed since the E\textendash O boundary because they were protected under non-erosive cold-based ice. The reconstructions provide a better-defined boundary condition for modeling that seeks to understand interaction between the Antarctic ice sheet and climate, along with more robust estimates of past ice volumes under a range of orbital settings and greenhouse gas concentrations.},

  abstract = {In this study, based on a 2-D thermomechanical finite element model, the uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) is discussed in relation to the flexural uplift of a rheologically layered lithosphere, which is described by Vening-Meinesz's cantilever kinematics. The general model behaviour shows that the thickness of the crust and the geothermal gradient in the lithosphere are the principal factors in controlling the effective elastic thickness (T e). Although T e is also significantly dependent on the magnitude of the uplift and the wet or dry rheological condition of rocks, these two factors do not have a dominant influence on the half-wavelength of the TAM. The model with a plausible crustal structure beneath Antarctica shows that the thermal structure beneath East Antarctica is the critical factor, controlling the half-wavelength of the TAM. If there is a significant radiogenic heat source in the Antarctic lithosphere, T e beneath East Antarctica is estimated to be 50 km, at most, and the lithosphere has no potential to explain an exceptionally large-scale half-wavelength of the TAM. Even for the model without a heat source, if East Antarctica is significantly thermally influenced by West Antarctica, T e is estimated to be about 60 km, and it is difficult to reproduce the half-wavelength of the TAM. Contrarily, when a radiogenic heat source is absent and the thermal structure beneath East Antarctica is not significantly affected by that beneath West Antarctica, the rheological structure beneath East Antarctica has the potential to reproduce the half-wavelength of the TAM (T e {$\sim$} 100 km). Thus, the presence of a radiogenic heat source in the crust and mantle and the thermal influence of West Antarctica on East Antarctica are crucial factors in the reproduction of the half-wavelength found in the TAM.},

We estimated the bathymetry of this region from airborne gravity anomaly using simulated annealing. Unlike the current model which shows a comparatively flat seafloor beneath the calving front, our estimation results reveal a 255-m-deep shoal at the western side and a 1,050-m-deep trough at the eastern side, which are important topographic features controlling the ocean heat transport into the sub-ice cavity. The new model also reveals previously unknown depressions and sills that are critical to an improved modeling of the sub-ice-shelf ocean circulation and induced basal melting.},

However, its estimation capability has not been demonstrated by real projects. Theoretical analysis through admittance shows that compared with gravity disturbance, gravity gradient is more sensitive to the short-wavelength seafloor topography but diminishes faster with the increase of the distance between the seafloor and airplane, indicating its superiority is recovering short-wavelength topographic features over shallow waters. We present the first numerical experiment that estimates seafloor topography from a 0.4-km resolution, real airborne gravity gradients. It is shown that airborne gravity gradiometry can recover smaller topographic features than typical airborne gravimetry, but the estimation accuracy is only {$\pm$}17 m due to the presence of subsurface density variations. The long-wavelength effect of the subsurface density variations can be removed with the aid of constraining bathymetry inside the study area, whereas the short wavelengths cannot. This study expands the applications of airborne gravity gradiometry, and helps glaciologists understand its performance in seafloor topography estimation.},

  abstract = {Inferring seafloor topography from gravity anomaly currently is the dominant method to obtain a global view of the oceans. Standard techniques rely on an approximate, linear relationship between topography and gravity, which is valid only if the local topography is smooth compared with the regional topography, so the estimation accuracy in the very rugged areas is low. Current methods can be improved by removing the linear approximation and estimating the topography through simulated annealing and by using gravity gradiometry that is more sensitive to topography at short wavelengths than the gravity anomaly. Simulated annealing is a global optimization technique that can process nonlinear inverse problems. It is developed to estimate the seafloor depths by minimizing the difference between the observed and forward-computed vertical gravity gradients. The method is tested on altimetry-derived gravity gradients in a 2{$\circ$} \texttimes{} 2{$\circ$} area of rugged seafloor topography in the West Pacific Ocean and results in estimates with a root-mean-square error of {$\pm$}236 m. Compared to estimates from an existing model obtained by standard techniques this represents an accuracy improvement of 22\%.},

  abstract = {The stability of modern ice shelves is threatened by atmospheric and oceanic warming. The geologic record of formerly glaciated continental shelves provides a window into the past of how ice shelves responded to a warming climate. Fields of deep (-560 m), linear iceberg furrows on the outer, western Ross Sea continental shelf record an early post-Last Glacial Maximum episode of ice-shelf collapse that was followed by continuous retreat of the grounding line for {$\sim$}200 km. Runaway grounding line conditions culminated once the ice became pinned on shallow banks in the western Ross Sea. This early episode of ice-shelf collapse is not observed in the eastern Ross Sea, where more episodic grounding line retreat took place. More widespread ({$\sim$}280,000 km               2               ) retreat of the ancestral Ross Ice Shelf occurred during the late Holocene. This event is recorded in sediment cores by a shift from terrigenous glacimarine mud to diatomaceous open-marine sediment as well as an increase in radiogenic beryllium (               10               Be) concentrations. The timing of ice-shelf breakup is constrained by compound specific radiocarbon ages, the first application of this technique systematically applied to Antarctic marine sediments. Breakup initiated around 5 ka, with the ice shelf reaching its current configuration {$\sim$}1.5 ka. In the eastern Ross Sea, the ice shelf retreated up to 100 km in about a thousand years. Three-dimensional thermodynamic ice-shelf/ocean modeling results and comparison with ice-core records indicate that ice-shelf breakup resulted from combined atmospheric warming and warm ocean currents impinging onto the continental shelf.},

  abstract = {Many glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula are now rapidly losing mass. Understanding of the dynamics of these fast-flowing glaciers, and their potential future behaviour, can be improved through ice sheet modelling studies. Inverse methods are commonly used in ice sheet models to infer the spatial distribution of a basal friction coefficient, which has a large effect on the basal velocity and ice deformation. Here we use the full-Stokes Elmer/Ice model to simulate the Wordie Ice Shelf\textendash Fleming Glacier system in the southern Antarctic Peninsula. With an inverse method, we infer the pattern of the basal friction coefficient from surface velocities observed in 2008. We propose a multi-cycle spin-up scheme to reduce the influence of the assumed initial englacial temperature field on the final inversion. This is particularly important for glaciers like the Fleming Glacier, which have areas of strongly temperature-dependent deformational flow in the fast-flowing regions. Sensitivity tests using various bed elevation datasets, ice front positions and boundary conditions demonstrate the importance of highaccuracy ice thickness/bed geometry data and precise location of the ice front boundary.},

  abstract = {Bathymetric sills are important features in the ocean-filled cavities beneath a few fast-retreating ice shelves in West Antarctica and northern Greenland. The sills can be high enough to obstruct the cavity circulation and thereby modulate glacial melt rates. This study focuses on the idealized problem of diabatically driven, sillconstrained overturning circulation in a cavity. The circulation beneath fast-melting ice shelves can generally be characterized by an inflow of relatively warm dense water (with temperatures of a few degrees Celsius above the local freezing point) at depth and cold, less-dense, outflowing water, which exhibits an approximately two-layer structure in observations. We use a two-layer isopycnal hydrostatic model to study the cross-sill exchange of these waters in ice shelf cavities wide enough to be rotationally dominated. A quasigeostrophic constraint is determined for the transport imposed by the stratification. Relative to this constraint, the key parameters controlling the transport and its variability are the sill height relative to the bottom layer thickness and the strength of the friction relative to the potential vorticity (PV) gradient imposed by the sill. By varying these two key parameters, we simulate a diversity of flow phenomena. For a given meridional pressure gradient, the crosssill transport is controlled by sill height beyond a critical threshold in the eddy-permitting, low-friction regime, while it is insensitive to friction in both the low-friction and high-friction regimes. We present theoretical ideas to explain the flow characteristics: a Stommel boundary layer for the friction-dominated regime; mean\textendash eddy PV balances and energy conversion in the low-friction, low-sill regime; and hydraulic control in the low-friction, high-sill regime, with various estimates for transport in each of these regimes.},

Love waves provide greater resolution for shallow structure, and coupled with Rayleigh waves, can constrain radial anisotropy by comparing vertically (VSV) and horizontally (VSH) polarized shear velocities. In this study, we jointly analyze Rayleigh and Love wave phase and group velocities from ambient noise to develop a new radially anisotropic velocity model for West and Central Antarctica with an improved shallow crustal resolution using all broadband data collected in Antarctica over the past 20 years. Group and phase velocity maps for Rayleigh and Love waves are estimated and inverted for shear wave velocity structure using a Monte Carlo method. We determine a new sediment distribution map that reveals a thick sedimentary basin ({$\sim$}4 km) beneath the Southeastern Ross Embayment. Sediment thicknesses at interior basins such as the Polar Subglacial Basin and Bentley Subglacial Trench are modest ({$<$}1.5 km), suggesting that these basins are sediment-starved. The shallow crust as well as the mid-to-lower crust in several places shows strong positive anisotropy (VSH {$>$} VSV), likely due to lattice preferred orientation of mica-bearing rocks. However, large regions of the mid-to-lower crust show negative anisotropy, likely due to lattice preferred orientation of plagioclase. The uppermost mantle is characterized by strong positive radial anisotropy (4\%\textendash 8\%) in West Antarctica, with the largest anisotropy beneath the Transantarctic and Whitmore Mountains, likely resulting from horizontal olivine preferred orientation due to tectonic activity.},
